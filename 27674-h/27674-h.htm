<h2>THE BOY VOLUNTEERS SERIES</h2>

<h3>By KENNETH WARD</h3>

<p class="cen"><i>12mo. Cloth. Fully Illustrated. 50&cent; per Volume</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Newest Boys' Books on the European War, Relating the
Adventures of Two American Boys and Their Experiences
in Battle and on Air Scout Duty. All Profusely Illustrated
with Authentic Drawings</span>.</p>

<p class="cen"><b>The Boy Volunteers on the Belgian Front</b></p>

<p>Describes the adventures of two American boys who were in Europe
when the great war commenced. Their enlistment with Belgian
troops and their remarkable experiences are based upon actual
occurrences and the book is replete with line drawings of fighting
machines, air planes and maps of places where the most important
battles took place and of other matters of interest.</p>

<p class="cen"><b>The Boy Volunteers with the French Airmen</b></p>

<p>This book relates the further adventures of the young Americans in
France, where they viewed the fighting from above the firing lines.
From this book the reader gains considerable knowledge of the
different types of air planes and battle planes used by the warring
nations, as all descriptions are illustrated with unusually clear line
drawings.</p>

<p class="cen"><b>The Boy Volunteers with the British Artillery</b></p>

<p>How many boys to-day know anything about the great guns now
being used on so many European battle fronts? Our young friends
had the rare opportunity of witnessing, at first hand, a number
of these terrific duels, and the story which is most fascinatingly
told is illustrated with numerous drawings of the British, French
and German field pieces.</p>

<p class="cen"><b>The Boy Volunteers with the Submarine Fleet</b></p>

<p>Our young heroes little expected to be favored with so rare an experience
as a trip under the sea in one of the great submarines. In
this book the author accurately describes the submarine in action,
and the many interesting features of this remarkable fighting craft
are made clear to the reader by a series of splendid line drawings.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h2>THE OMINOUS WARNING ON SHIPBOARD</h2>
<br />

<p>"Submarine two points to starboard, sir!"
shouted a voice.</p>

<p>Instantly there was confusion; the captain
sprang from the end of the bridge to the board
behind the quartermaster and pushed a lever to
the right.</p>

<p>"Ralph, come out quickly; the second officer has
just shouted to the captain that a submarine is in
sight," said Alfred, as he rushed into the reading
room where Ralph was deeply engrossed in a book.</p>

<p>Ralph needed no second warning. Together
with a dozen or more, who were in the room, he
sprang to the door, and followed Alfred, who was
now nearing the bridge.</p>

<p>"Can you see it?" asked Ralph excitedly.</p>

<p>"No; but they are pointing to the right; it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>seems as though we are turning around," responded
Alfred.</p>

<p>"So we are," said Ralph. "There! what is
that?" shouted Ralph, as he followed the direction
pointed out by the second officer.</p>

<p>The captain gave another wrench to the wheel,
and the ship straightened out on its course. All
eyes were now directed to a point to the right,
and astern, for the boat had described a half
circle.</p>

<p>"Wait till I get the glasses," said Alfred, as he
dived for the main companionway, and slid down
the railing.</p>

<p>He was back in record time, followed by his
father and mother, accompanied by Ralph's
mother. Needless to say all were agitated, for
they had been told on the morning of sailing that
the trip might be a dangerous one, and it was only
urgent business necessity that compelled Mr. Elton
to take the risk.</p>

<p>"I can see something away back there, just like
a trail of foam. I wonder whether that's what
they are so excited about on the bridge?" questioned
Alfred, as he lowered the glasses, and
glanced up at the officers who were vigorously discussing
the situation.</p>

<p>"Let me look," said Ralph, reaching for the
glasses. He was silent for a few moments, then,
handing the glasses to Mr. Elton, he continued:
"There is something coming; see if you can make
it out."</p>

<p>Mr. Elton gazed intently, and turned to his wife,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>as he said: "I am afraid that is a torpedo on the
way now."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he made the remark quietly; those
around heard the warning, and the boys glanced
at the bridge. The captain again moved the wheel,
and the ship swerved.</p>

<p>"It is a torpedo," shouted Ralph. Every one
leaned over the ship's side and waited, some with
terror on their faces, others pale but calm. Two
or three rushed for the companionway, and several
fainted.</p>

<p>"It's going to miss! It's going to miss!"
shouted Alfred. He turned around and waved his
cap to the officers on the bridge, but they were too
intent watching the submarine to notice the salutation.
It was evident, however, from their actions
that they had no immediate fear.</p>

<p>It was with a thrill that the two hundred passengers,
who were lined up on the port side of the
steamship, saw a foamy trail, one hundred feet
distant, pass alongside their vessel, and disappear
in the distance, far ahead.</p>

<p>"There comes another one," said a voice.</p>

<p>It was easy to distinguish the second peril, and
it seemed to come straight and true. The ship
veered slightly from its course, and breathlessly
the passengers watched the trail. On, on it came.
The vessel again slightly changed its course, and
this time the torpedo went wide of the mark.</p>

<p>"Now, for the next one," said Alfred.</p>

<p>"Ah! we are now too far ahead, and going too
fast for them. Even if the submarine comes to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>the surface it cannot possibly catch us," said the
navigating officer, who passed along and quieted
the anxious ones.</p>

<p>Thus, for the time being, they escaped, but the
vigilance was greater than ever. They would be
in the danger zone for twelve hours more.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Two and a half years previous to this time, Mr.
and Mrs. Elton, accompanied by their son Alfred,
Mrs. Elton's sister, and her son Ralph, were traveling
through Europe, and happened to be in Germany
when war was declared. The boys, together
with Mr. Elton's chauffeur, were on their way to
Antwerp with their car, and were pursued by the
Germans as they were entering Belgium territory.</p>

<p>Their car was requisitioned by the Belgium government,
and as the German forces entered Belgium
south of Liege, they were cut off from reaching
Antwerp. In the effort to make their way
across the country the two boys met the Belgian
forces, and were in the first battle, which was
fought between the Germans and Belgians. They
took part in the defense of Belgian territory with
the Belgian forces, from Liege, to Louvain, Aerschott,
and Malines, until the city of Antwerp was
besieged, and were among the last to leave when
the Belgians evacuated that place.</p>

<p>They were fortunate enough, however, to reach
French territory with the bulk of the Belgian
army, and arrived at Dunkirk, on the Channel,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>during that period when the British were sending
over the first forces to resist the invasion of
France.</p>

<p>The second day they visited the hangars where
the British were setting up their aircraft and
training the recruits for the aviation service.
While approaching the grounds they were the witnesses
of an accident to one of the flyers, who
made a disastrous landing near them, and they
were prompt enough to lift the machine from one
of the men, which saved his life.</p>

<p>This incident was the changing point in their
career, for they then determined to enter the aviation
corps, if possible. Despite their efforts, they
were not able to succeed, at this time, and as the
father of Alfred had sent word to them to meet
him in Paris, they regretfully worked their way
to that city, only to learn, on arriving, that Mr.
Elton was not permitted to leave Germany.</p>

<p>By an accidental circumstance they went to Bar-le-Duc,
in eastern France, and visited the aviation
grounds there. Having made themselves useful,
they were favored with the privilege of making
ascensions, and were instructed in the handling
of the trial machines on the grounds.</p>

<p>On one occasion they were aloft with Lieutenant
Guyon, who, owing to heart troubles, fainted while
at a high altitude, and the boys brought the machine
down safely. Thereafter, the lieutenant was
their constant friend, and when the corps moved
to Verdun they were regularly enrolled as members,
and subsequently became engaged in many
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>exciting flights. While on a scouting operation
with their friend, several German machines appeared
and a battle followed in which the machine
was injured, and during the descent both boys
were wounded.</p>

<p>The lieutenant was caught in the wreckage, as
the machine finally plunged to earth, and within a
week died of his wounds. The boys were heart-broken
at his death, and after a week at the base
hospital were transferred to the American hospital
in Paris. After recovery they were regularly
discharged from the service, and started for
home.</p>

<p>On their way to the Channel they became interested
in the artillery branch and happened to take
part in the first great French drive in the Somme
region and later were with the British artillery
when it began its great fight against the Germans
in the region west of Bapaume.</p>

<p>It was there that Alfred's parents and Ralph's
mother learned of their whereabouts, and, through
the kindly offices of the American ambassador,
were permitted to visit the battery where the boys
were stationed, and where they finally prevailed
upon them to accompany them home.</p>

<p>They sailed from Bordeaux early in the morning
of the same day that the events took place
which we have just related. On the day of sailing
the thrilling news reached France that President
Wilson had given the German minister his passports,
and while such an act does not, ordinarily,
mean war, the strained relations between the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>United States and Germany made it probable that
war would follow.</p>

<p>As stated, Mr. Elton's business compelled him
to sail, notwithstanding the danger, and they now
found themselves within the danger zone prescribed
by the German authorities, for, as they
were sailing on a ship belonging to one of the belligerent
nations, they knew that it was a prey for
any submarine and subject to be sunk without
warning.</p>

<p>Although instructions of a general nature had
been issued by the captain after the vessel left
port, he called the passengers together immediately
after the excitement attending the appearance
of the submarine had died away, and addressed
them as follows:</p>

<p>"For the next twelve or fifteen hours we shall be
in the danger zone, and it is imperative that each
of you should at all times carry a life belt. I impress
this on you not for the purpose of creating
alarm, but because I know that people become
careless. The officers will give full instructions
to all of you as to the way the belts should be worn,
so there will be no confusion at the last moment.</p>

<p>"And now, another thing, which you must remember.
More lives are lost through undue excitement
than from the real danger, in case of
trouble. We are here for the purpose of giving
due warning and assistance, and every man in the
ship's crew will be faithful to his duty. Do not
rush about and become excited, because that unduly
alarms those about you, I will give you
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>ample warning. Five short blasts on the ship's
whistle will call you to the boats. When you hear
that go to your cabins quickly, seize such clothing
as you have prepared for such an event, and if
you have not strapped on the life belt do so at
once.</p>

<p>"It should be the first duty of the men to aid
the women and children, see that the belts are
properly put on, and assist them to the deck. Once
there, go as quickly as possible to the davits and
await orders, for the officers and men will be there
to direct and take charge of the passengers.
Should the boat be so badly hit that it is impossible
for all the passengers to get into the boat
before the vessel goes down, the men must see to
it that every one goes overboard and clears the
ship's side.</p>

<p>"Many women will, even in this extremity, refuse
to jump overboard without their husbands,
but in such cases there must be no hesitancy on
the part of the men. Do not argue, but push them
overboard, and the life belts will hold them in position
in the water until the waiting boats can
rescue them. There will be no danger of drowning
under those conditions, but be sure to jump as
far from the vessel as possible."</p>

<p>It was not such a speech as tended to relieve
nervousness, but it certainly made every one
within hearing very thoughtful. Women, and men,
as well, turned white, and many of them timidly
examined the tiny life belts which were handed
out.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>"It seems that we get into trouble wherever we
go," said Alfred, not in a spirit of alarm, however,
but more because he felt a deep concern for
his father and mother.</p>

<p>"Oh, Ralph, isn't this terrible!" said his
mother, as she came forward.</p>

<p>"It certainly is; but this is something like the
experiences we have had for over two years, and
it doesn't make it seem so bad;&mdash;do you think so?"
he added, addressing Alfred.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't be at all worried, Auntie," responded
Alfred. "Here comes mother; I hope she
is not broken up or worried."</p>

<p>"No," replied Mrs. Elton. "It is dreadful, but
it is no worse for us than for others. I am glad
the captain spoke as plainly as he did. We must
understand and do our duty."</p>

<p>"Now, Mother, you and Auntie go to the ladies'
room and stay there. If anything happens we will
know where to find you," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"But I want you to come and stay with us," replied
Mrs. Elton.</p>

<p>"We cannot do that," replied Alfred. "We
have fine glasses and every one should be on the
watch. It takes a great many eyes to see in all
directions."</p>

<p>"Alfred is right," said Mr. Elton. "I will remain
with you; but do not be alarmed for the present."</p>

<p>"Wait until I get my binoculars," said Ralph, as
he rushed down to the cabin.</p>

<p>He was up at once, and together they ran <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>forward
to the bridge, as the second officer descended.</p>

<p>"Can we be of service to you in any way?" said
Alfred, pointing to their glasses.</p>

<p>"Indeed, you can," said the officer.</p>

<p>At that moment the captain, leaning over the
rail of the bridge, shouted: "Come up, boys; those
are the right kind of weapons. We ought to have
dozens more of the same kind."</p>

<p>The boys fairly stumbled up the steep, narrow
ladder that led to the bridge.</p>

<p>"At your service," said Ralph.</p>

<p>The captain smiled, as he said: "Take positions
at the end of the bridge."</p>

<p>The boys walked across to the other side, and
Ralph elevated his glasses.</p>

<p>A moment later the captain, in his walk to and
fro, stopped before the boys. "You have evidently
had occasion to use the binoculars before,
but probably not while at sea," he observed.</p>

<p>"No," replied Ralph; "we used them in flying
machines and while serving in the artillery, but
this is really the first opportunity we have had to
use them on shipboard."</p>

<p>"Then a little instruction will be of service to
you and to all of us," said the captain. "I noticed
that you were sweeping the sea to the rear.
That is not necessary, for at our speed a torpedo
boat would not be able to catch us. All your time
should be devoted to scanning that quadrant from
straight ahead to a point but a little astern of your
left quarter, as it is from that section, and the
corresponding section on the right side of the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>vessel
that we expect the enemy; do you understand
what I mean?"</p>

<p>"I think so," replied Ralph. "But suppose a
submarine should be well ahead of us and submerge,
and then wait until we have passed. In
that case couldn't it again come up and send a
torpedo into the stern of the ship?"</p>

<p>"That might be possible, but not probable. A
submarine is absolutely in the dark when completely
submerged," said the captain. "It must
come to the surface sufficiently near to bring its
periscope out of the water, and that would reveal
its presence to us. It would be a pretty hard job
for a navigator in a submarine to calculate when
the boat had passed sufficiently near to know the
opportune time to come to the surface and give us
the shot."</p>

<p>"But couldn't they come near enough to take
a chance? They might come up 500 feet away
or 2,000. At either distance they could land a torpedo,
couldn't they?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"Quite true; but the submarine might not know
whether we were armed or not, and it would not
take the risk of exposure in that reckless manner,"
replied the captain.</p>

<p>"But we are not armed, are we?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"No; our guns will be ready for us on the return
trip," answered the captain. After a moment
he continued: "Let me also give you a hint
as to the particular manner of using the glasses
to get a correct view. Do not attempt to take in
the entire field at one sweep. Sight at a point near
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>the ship, say at a distance of a quarter of a mile;
then slowly raise the glasses so that your view
grows more and more distant and finally the focal
point reaches the horizon. Then turn a point to
the right or to the left, and bring down the forward
end of the glasses until the view is again concentrated
on the point nearest the ship."</p>

<p>"That is something like making observations on
a flying machine," replied Alfred, "only in that
case the glass is held stationary, as the machine
moves along, and in that way objects can be seen
much better than by sweeping it around continuously.
We learned that from Lieutenant
Guyon."</p>

<p>"Quite true; I see you are well qualified to observe.
But to continue: after you have thus made
the first observation as I have explained, the
glasses should be held horizontally to take in the
view at the horizon, and then swept around at
that angle to the right or to the left, depressing
it at each swing. That is called sweeping the sea."</p>

<p>"I know two men who have glasses," said
Ralph. "Shall I get them?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if you can; this is the kind of service
which is appreciated," said the captain.</p>

<p>Ralph sprang down the ladder, and ran along
the deck. He was absent for some time, but soon
appeared with two men.</p>

<p>"Come on," said Ralph, as he ascended the ladder.
The men hesitated for a moment, and followed,
as an officer appeared and invited them to
come up.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h2>THE TORPEDOED SHIP</h2>
<br />

<p>During the next hour or more every field glass
on board ship was put into use, and many were
the weary arms that used them until the luncheon
hour arrived at one o'clock. The captain, knowing
how trying the constant watching must be to
civilians who are not used to this work, appointed
two watches, so they might relieve each other
every hour.</p>

<p>The boys went to the dining room, and as Mr.
Elton and his family sat at the captain's table,
the latter took occasion during the meal to refer
to Ralph and Alfred's services on the bridge in
commendatory terms, which was greatly appreciated
by their parents.</p>

<p>"I am curious to know," said Ralph, "what the
officer meant when he said 'two points to starboard.'"</p>

<p>"That is explained in this way," replied the captain.
"The compass is divided into thirty-two
points, or eight points in each quadrant."</p>

<p>"I remember you spoke about a quadrant when
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>we were on the bridge. What is a quadrant?"
asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"I should have said, in the beginning, that the
compass is divided into four parts, one line running,
we will say, east and west, and the other line
north and south. In that way there are four cardinal
points. You will understand, therefore, that
from the north cardinal point to the east cardinal
point, which represents one quadrant, are eight
points, and so on, from the cardinal point east to
south, are eight more points," responded the captain.</p>

<p>"Then when the officer said 'two points to starboard,'
did he mean two points from one of the
cardinal points?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"No, he had reference to two points from the
line ahead, or for the time being, he took the line
upon which we were traveling, as one of the cardinal
lines, and when he said two points he described
a line which was just one-fourth of the
distance around the circle or quadrant to the
east," answered the captain.</p>

<p>"Then we might say that the keel of the ship
is one of the cardinal lines, and the bridge, which
runs across the ship is the other line?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"That is a very homely and plain way of putting
it," replied the captain.</p>

<p>An hour thereafter, while the boys were on the
bridge, they noticed the first signs of excitement
on the part of the officers. A message had been
handed the captain a few moments before. Of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>course, all were curious to know the news it contained,
but no one seemed to be bold enough to
ask any questions.</p>

</div>

<p>As the second watch appeared at the bridge the
boys descended and rejoined their parents. A
voice was heard outside summoning the passengers
on deck. They were ranged along the
deck house, and the second officer appeared.</p>

<p>"I wish to make an announcement, and give
further instructions. In order that there may be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>no confusion, in the event the enemy should attack
us and compel the passengers to take to the
boats, I am going to assign places to all of you, so
that the moment you hear the five bells you will
know where to go, ready to man the boats. Now,
notice the numbers on the boats, which you see are
swung out on the davits ready to be launched.
Be particular to note where your boat is located,
and its number. When you come up the companionway
from your cabin, fix in your mind whether
your own boat is on the right or on the left side;
some are liable to become confused in coming up.</p>

<p>"Boat No. 1; Mr. Elton, how many are in your
party?"</p>

<p>"Five," was the answer.</p>

<p>"Then three more will be assigned; Mr. Wardlaw,
wife and daughter; that will complete the first
boat. No. 2," continued the officer, as he made the
assignments. This was continued until the entire
list was completed.</p>

<p>Four seamen were then designated for each of
the boats, and the steward was directed to prepare
emergency food for the different boats, and by direct
orders the food was actually placed in the
boats.</p>

<p>It was really with a sigh of relief from the suspense
that the boys awaited the signal for their
term of duty on the bridge. They were in their
places instantly, and seized the glasses. It was
now four o'clock in the afternoon. They were
moving toward the setting sun. The sky was free
of clouds and the ocean fairly smooth. It was an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>ideal sea for observation. The boys were on the
port or left side of the ship.</p>

<p>"Ralph," said Alfred under his breath, as he
moved toward Ralph, and laid his hand on his arm,
without lowering his glasses, "look over there!
there!&mdash;two or three points,&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I see it,&mdash;yes,&mdash;Captain, what is that, a half-mile
off to the left?" interrupted Ralph.</p>

<p>The captain shot a glance in the direction indicated.
"Three points to port!" he said, as he
sprang to the wheel and gave a signal to the engineer.
As he came back to the point of observation,
he said:</p>

<p>"Young eyes are very sharp. You have beaten
the watch on the top mast."</p>

<p>The officer in charge of the telephone beckoned
to the captain. The latter rushed over, and the
boys saw him nod.</p>

<p>"How far are they from us?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"Two miles," was the answer.</p>

<p>"Two miles!" said Ralph in astonishment.
"Why, I thought I was stretching it when I said a
half mile."</p>

<p>"To be more exact, the range finder in the
crow's nest makes the distance 10,980 feet," said
the captain.</p>

<p>"Well, they can't hit us at that distance," said
Ralph, "can they?"</p>

<p>"No; we can easily avoid that fellow, but he may
have appeared as a ruse," said the captain, glancing
to starboard, with an anxious air.</p>

<p>The first officer standing near, although intently
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>watching the submarine in the distance, remarked:
"It is now the custom for two or more of the
undersea boats to operate in unison; the one we
are now looking at may be a decoy."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by 'decoy'" asked Ralph,
in astonishment. "Is it likely that they would
expect us to steer right into them?"</p>


<div class="img"><a name="imagep030" id="imagep030"></a>
<a href="images/imagep030.png">
<img border="0" src="images/imagep030.png" width="55%" alt="The Submarine Decoy" /></a><br />
<p class="cen" style="margin-top: .2em;"><i>The Submarine Decoy</i><span class="totoi"><a href="#toi">ToList</a></span></p>
</div>

<p>"No; their idea is to have one of the submarines
show up in front, knowing that the intercepted vessel
will turn to avoid it. Then the other submarine,
with nothing but its periscope above the
water, and on the other side of the sailing course
of the ship, will be in position, the moment the turn
is made, to deliver the shot. That is why the captain
has gone to the other side, as you will notice
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>the vessel is now going to starboard," said the
officer.</p>

<p>The ship had now turned so that it was broadside
to the distant submarine. Not only its conning
tower was now visible, but a long black object
fore and aft could be plainly observed.</p>

<p>"Three points to port!" shouted the captain.</p>

<p>The quartermaster swung the wheel around, and
the ship seemed to heel over, so suddenly did the
rudder act.</p>

<p>"One point to starboard, and full speed ahead!"
was the next order from the captain.</p>

<p>It seemed that the order had no more than been
executed than he again sang out:</p>

<p>"Two points to port!"</p>

<p>"What is that for?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"He is zig-zagging the ship through the sea,"
replied the officer.</p>

<p>"What for?" inquired Ralph.</p>

<p>"There is another submarine three points to
starboard astern."</p>

<p>"Then,&mdash;then the captain,&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes; the one behind us is near enough to reach
us if we keep on a straight course, but the captain
has manoeuvered so as to bring him directly in
our wake, and continually changed the target so
that the submarine cannot aim with accuracy," interrupted
the officer.</p>

<p>The passengers on the decks below did not need
to be told that something unusual was happening.
The changing course of the ship, the unusual activity
on the bridge, the leveling of the glasses to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>the port side and to the stern by the different
groups, were sufficient warnings of the presence
of the dread monsters.</p>

<p>The submarine on the port side was now coming
forward with all the speed it possessed, and again
the captain turned the ship another point to starboard.
The funnels were belching smoke, and
sparks flying from the top. The engineers were
putting on forced draft and the ship seemed to be
trembling as it shot through the smooth sea. It
was an ideal condition for the launching of a torpedo.</p>

<p>"Torpedo coming on starboard side!" shouted
a voice.</p>

<p>Every one now rushed to the right side of the
bridge. There was a shriek below. From an unexpected
quarter the third submarine's periscope
was visible, and a foamy trail, straight as a mark,
began to lengthen out toward their vessel.</p>

<p>"Reverse! Reverse engines!" shouted the captain.
The order was executed, but too late. The
trail came nearer and grew broader. Some of the
passengers put their hands over their eyes, others
stood like fixed statues. The captain placed his
hand to his brow, but quickly turned.</p>

<p>"Order the men to the boat!" he said in a quiet
voice, as he stepped forward and seized the handle
of the boat's whistle.</p>

<p>No sooner had the order been given when a terrific
crash followed. The bridge seemed to have
been seized with a giant hand and it vibrated with
an intense force. A hundred feet from the stern
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>of the ship a great mass of water shot upward and
fragments of the deck were hoisted up and scattered
around.</p>

<p>The ship at first swayed to port and then quickly
swung back to starboard, but did not again roll
back to port. The captain shook his head. There
was a perceptible list in the position of the ship.</p>

<p>"Take your position in the boats!" he shouted
to the men on the bridge, and as he did so he
quickly pulled the lever,&mdash;one, two, three, four,
five.</p>

<p>By the time the last blast sounded the seamen
were at the boats assigned to them. The engines
had stopped. The passengers, all except those
who had fainted, had left the deck. Ralph and
Alfred made a dash for the waiting room. Their
parents were not there. Down they went to the
cabins, passing on the way the crowded hallways
and the unutterable confusion which resulted from
the order to hurriedly leave the ship.</p>

<p>They found their parents in the cabin, and, due
to the forethought of Mr. Elton, the lifebuoys had
been adjusted, and their valuables secured beforehand.
Others, however, were not so fortunate.
Across the way were several women and children.</p>

<p>"Let me help you," said Alfred, as he entered
the first cabin. "I will take care of the baby," he
remarked, as he picked it up, while the mother
was almost frantic.</p>

<p>"I will take the other one," shouted Ralph.</p>

<p>"We can't stop here another minute," said Alfred.
"Do you see how the ship is leaning over?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>"Come on, Mother," cried Ralph; "follow us
or we may not be able to go up the stairs."</p>

<p>Alfred crowded close behind Ralph, and Mr. Elton
assisted the two women along the passageway.
All arrived on deck, the boys with the two children
in their arms.</p>

<p>"Where is No. 8?" "I can't find No. 9," said
another. "What has become of the girl?"
shrieked one; "Are we going to turn over?" asked
a trembling voice. The officers were going to and
fro, mingling with the passengers.</p>

<p>"What is your boat number?" asks one officer.
"This way; that is the place you are assigned to."</p>

<p>Mr. Elton and his party reached No. 1 without
accident, and all but the boys were safely placed in
the boat.</p>

<p>"Come on, boys," said Mr. Elton. "But where
is the mother of the children?" he asked, as he saw
the boys were unaccompanied.</p>

<p>"Take the baby," said Alfred, as he passed it
to his mother.</p>

<p>Ralph handed the little girl to one of the seamen,
and sprang after Alfred. There was now a
dangerous list, and Mrs. Elton noticed it.</p>

<p>"Is there any danger if our boys go below to the
stateroom?" she asked the petty officer, who was
holding the rope connected with the tackle of their
boat.</p>

<p>"She'll have to sway over a great deal further
to go down," he remarked.</p>

<p>This comforted her for the moment. Passengers
were still coming up from the c<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>ompanionways;
some were being dragged along, and others
acted like drunken men and women. It was a terribly
trying sight.</p>

<p>An old man shambled forward as he emerged
from the cabin door, glanced along at the filled
boats held in the davit, tried to speak, and fell
headlong on the deck. A surgeon near by rushed
up, turned him over, felt of his heart and pulse,
shook his head, and drew the body close up to the
side of the cabin wall. Then the officer made a
search to ascertain the name of the man, and extracted
papers from his pockets.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the boys had not returned, and the
ship was turning over on its side more and more.</p>

<p>"Launch the boats!" ordered the captain.</p>

<p>"But our boys! our boys!" shrieked Ralph's
mother, but as she arose she was forcibly restrained.
The captain did not hear, and at the
command the boats went down. Even then a half-dozen
passengers emerged from the door too late,
and one of them, notwithstanding the warning,
was without a life belt.</p>

<p>The ship's deck was now at an angle of fully
thirty degrees,&mdash;as steep as the ordinary roof.
Those emerging from the cabin on the port side
could not maintain a footing, but were compelled
to slide down to the side railing. This was the
situation when Ralph and Alfred reached the door
which led to the deck from the companionway.
They were carrying the woman whose children
they had rescued, as she was in a frenzy, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>struggled with the boys. The moment the inclined
deck was reached Alfred said:</p>

<p>"See that she goes overboard, and I will go
down for that little girl," and he crawled back
into the ship.</p>

<p>Ralph finally succeeded in loosening the
woman's hold, and together they slid down the
deck. The woman was now uncontrollable. She
threw her arms about wildly, and cried for her
children. Ralph pointed to the boats below, but
this did not quiet her. Taking advantage of the
moment when both hands were free, Ralph, by a
terrific effort, pushed her across the railing, and,
with a loud shriek, she shot downward.</p>

<p>Ralph looked around, and caught a momentary
sight of his parents in the boat below. Mrs. Elton
was calling for Alfred. Ralph nodded his head
and tried to crawl back up the inclined deck, but
it was useless. An arm then appeared through
the door opening, then a head, and he knew it must
be Alfred.</p>

<p>"Can't you help me up?" shouted Ralph.</p>

<p>Alfred disengaged himself and extended his
body down along the deck. This enabled Ralph to
seize hold of his legs and draw himself up into the
doorway.</p>

<p>Once there he saw the trouble that Alfred had
to contend with. Lying half-way up the stairs
was a poor cripple, half dead with fright, and the
little girl, not much better. Laboriously, he had
assisted, first one and then the other, and was
about exhausted when Ralph came to the rescue.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h2>PRISONERS ON BOARD OF A SUBMARINE</h2>
<br />

<p>The captain was still on deck, together with the
first officer, both of them being at that time on the
upper side of the vessel. They made the most
careful examination of the staterooms and
searched every corner to be sure that no one lingered
behind. Coming forward they witnessed the
struggles of the boys with the cripple and the girl,
but the ship was now too far over on its side to
permit them to render assistance.</p>

<p>The cripple was soon brought to the door, and,
without ceremony, pushed down the incline. The
little girl followed, but before the boys could reach
the railing the poor cripple slipped over the railing
and disappeared. The boys held the child
aloft for a moment, and then dropped her into the
waves.</p>

<p>"Jump as far as you can!" shouted the captain.</p>

<p>Ralph placed a foot on the railing, and, looking
back at Alfred, said: "Here goes! Come on!"</p>

<p>Both boys landed at almost the same time. The
little girl was aroused by the cold water, and was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>wildly floundering about, but the cripple lay upon
the surface of the water, with face upturned, limp
and still. They glanced about; where were the
boats? They could not be far away.</p>

<p>"I am afraid he's done for," said Alfred, as he
glanced toward the cripple.</p>

<p>"Well, we might as well stay near him; he might
be all right," replied Ralph.</p>

<p>"Move away from the ship quickly," said a
voice in the water, not far away.</p>

<p>It was the captain. He was the last one to dive,
after he had seen every passenger safely off the
ship.</p>

<p>"We have no time to lose; take care of yourselves;
I will help the little girl," he continued, as
he threw the child on his back, and began to strike
out.</p>

<p>The sea had been calm up to this time, but no
sooner had the captain ceased speaking than a
tremendous wave almost engulfed them; they
seemed to be carried up, and then were forced
down by a giant swell. Another wave followed
and then another, until, finally, the oscillations of
the waves seemed to be growing less and less.</p>

<p>"Where is the ship?" cried Alfred.</p>

<p>"She's gone down; that's what made the
waves," said the captain.</p>

<p>The cripple's hand was raised up, and his eyes
began to roll.</p>

<p>"This fellow's all right, after all," said Ralph.
"I'll help him. I wonder where the boats are?"</p>

<p>The sun, which was going down while all this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>had been taking place, had now disappeared, and
there was that gray, lead-like appearance on the
waves that comes just before twilight.</p>

<p>"Keep up your courage, boys; we shall soon
have plenty of boats looking for us," said the captain.</p>

<p>Within less than a minute thereafter two boats
could be seen bobbing up and down not far away,
heading straight for those in the water. Ralph
was the first one caught by the strong arm of a
seaman, and then the little girl, now fully recovered
from her fright, received the care of a woman
in the boat.</p>

<p>Alfred assisted the cripple into the other boat,
and the captain ordered all the passengers transferred
to the boat which had just come up.</p>

<p>The boys then noticed that only three seamen
remained, together with the captain and first officer.</p>

<p>"You may remain with us," said the captain,
addressing Ralph and Alfred.</p>

<p>This was, indeed, a compliment to them, which
was appreciated.</p>

<p>"I know father, mother and auntie are all
right," said Alfred. "Do you think they saw us
get off?" he added anxiously.</p>

<p>"They were standing by when you jumped, but
when the ship made the last lurch, just before she
went down the seamen knew that they must pull
away to avoid being sucked under. It might have
been too dark for them actually to have seen you
get away, at the distance they were from the ship,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>but I don't think they will expect to see us before
morning."</p>

<p>"Why, do you intend to stay here all night?"
asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"No, but each boat crew has had instructions to
make for the nearest port, as rapidly as possible,"
replied the captain.</p>

<p>"Where are we now?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"In the Bay of Biscay, about one hundred and
fifty miles from the nearest land," answered the
captain.</p>

<p>"How long will it take us to reach land?" asked
Ralph.</p>

<p>"Possibly two days, or more; that depends on
the weather and the conditions in the bay. This is
the most turbulent body of water anywhere on the
Atlantic coast line, but it has been remarkably
smooth during the past twenty-four hours," answered
the captain.</p>

<p>"What is the name of the place that we are
heading for?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"St. Nazaire; a French town at the mouth of the
river Loire," was the reply.</p>

<p>It was now quite dark, and a haze prevented the
occupants of the boat from making any observation
of the stars, hence the sailing, or rather, the
rowing, had to be conducted by compass entirely,
the order being given by the captain to steer east
by north, a term which indicates that the course
was exactly two points north of a line running due
east and west.</p>

<p>Three miles an hour at the outside, would be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>considered good speed. Sails would have been
useless without a wind, and there was not the
slightest breeze, but about midnight there was an
apparent rocking in the little boat that indicated
a wind. Occasionally, there would be a jerk, as the
boat would be thrown from one side to the other.
The captain was awake and alert, but the boys
were lying in the bottom of the vessel near the
stern.</p>

<p>It was a trying, weary night, and when the sun
arose the sea was one panorama of short, choppy
waves. The seamen were tired with rowing, and
it was evident that no great effort was being made
to hurry the boat along.</p>

<p>"It does seem to me that the sun is coming up
on the wrong side this morning," remarked Alfred,
as they were partaking of the food prepared
and stowed in the boat's lockers.</p>

<p>"I imagine you are turned around somewhat,"
replied the captain. "The wind is now coming
from the east, and you see the sun almost ahead
of us. We are being carried west faster than the
rowers can take us eastward, hence we are practically
standing still, or rather going back, and
they are now merely holding the boat so as to give
us steerage way and prevent us from going into
the troughs between the waves."</p>

<p>"Have you sighted either of the other boats?"
asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"No; but one of the men observed a light at two
this morning, three points to starboard, which was,
possibly, one of our companions, but since that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>time we have searched the seas fruitlessly," answered
the captain.</p>

<p>"I don't know why it is that if all of the boats
steer to the same point that they should be scattered
in this way," said Alfred. "Can you explain
it, Captain?"</p>

<p>"It would not be so if in the open sea, or in mid-ocean;
there they would be likely to keep together,
or not separated more than three or four miles;
but it is quite another thing in this great bay," replied
the captain.</p>

<p>"Why should it be different here?" asked
Ralph.</p>

<p>"If you will take a map of the western part of
Europe, you will notice three great projecting
headlands, or points on the western shore of the
continent of Europe, namely, Iceland, in the north,
and the Spanish peninsula in the south. Midway
between you will notice Ireland and the British
Isles. The great Gulf stream comes down from
the north, passes Iceland, that is one branch, hugs
the coast of Ireland, and strikes the point of land
which projects out northwesterly from the main
Spanish land, so that a sort of maelstrom is set
up in the bay."</p>

<p>"How far are we from that point of land?"
asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"About two hundred miles northeast; and I
may also say that we are just about in the middle
of the Bay of Biscay, and at that point where the
sea is always more quiet than at any other part,"
answered the captain.</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>"Ship to starboard, sir," sang out the forward
watch.</p>

<p>The captain turned to the right and, after a
brief glance, lowered his hand. The boys looked
at him in wonder. Evidently the sight of the vessel
did not give him pleasure. It was a low-lying
craft, with two short masts.</p>

<p>"That looks like a submarine," shouted Ralph.</p>

<p>"You are right," replied the captain.</p>

<p>The submarine was coming forward rapidly,
and within fifteen minutes it was within hailing
distance. They now had an opportunity to examine
the ugly thing with the long black back and
the conning tower midway between the ends.</p>

<p>"Are those the periscopes?" asked Alfred. "I
didn't know they carried two of them."</p>

<p>"That is the practice now," said one seamen.</p>

<p>The submarine came straight toward them, then
sheered off and stopped alongside less than thirty
feet from the boat. One of the seamen tossed a
rope, which was grasped by a marine on the undersea
boat, and in that manner they were drawn close
up to the side of the submarine.</p>

<p>An officer now came forward, and in French invited
the captain to step aboard. There was a
broad smile on the officer's face, as he recognized
the captain of the vessel which they had torpedoed
the night before. With a respectful bow he requested
the captain to turn over the ship's papers.
The captain was, of course, powerless, but he refused
to do so on the plea that he did not have
them with him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>"Search the boat!" commanded the officer to
several of his crew.</p>

<p>The captain was about to go back to his boat
when the officer remarked:</p>

<p>"We prefer the pleasure of your company for
the present, sir."</p>

<p>The captain folded his arms, and stood straight
before the officer, as two marines jumped into the
boat, and began the search. Eventually, a leather
case was found, on which was inscribed the ship's
name. It was tossed up to the officer, who, after
receiving it, entered the conning tower, where he
remained for some time.</p>

<p>When he reappeared he said: "I shall have to
detain you," and, glancing down into the boat,
continued: "The two young men in the stern will
also come aboard."</p>

<p>The boys were astounded at this new turn of
affairs. Slowly they arose, and stepped on the
narrow platform which projected out from the
side of the submarine.</p>

<p>"There may be some reason why you should
wish to detain me, but there is no excuse for making
these young men prisoners; they are Americans
returning home, and cannot be considered as
belligerents," said the captain.</p>

<p>The lieutenant looked at the captain and turned
his gaze on the boys a few moments before replying:
"In what business were they engaged while
on the continent?"</p>

<p>The captain started slightly, while the officer
toyed with his mustache, and peered at the boys.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>"We haven't engaged in any particular business
on the continent," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"No; flying isn't engaging in any business, is
it?" inquired the officer.</p>

<p>"Well," said Alfred, "we took part in the Red
Cross service, were with the infantry, served a
time with the flying corps, then had a little experience
with the transportation service, helped
them out in the artillery, and did the best we could
everywhere we went, if that's what you wish to
know."</p>

<p>The officer gave the boys a cynical glance, and
nodded to one of the marines. The latter stepped
forward and began searching the boys, Ralph being
the first to undergo the ordeal; several letters,
a few trinkets, a knife and a purse, containing all
the boy possessed, were removed. The coat when
thrown back revealed a cross, suspended by a ribbon,
the decoration which had been bestowed on
the boys after their last flight at Verdun.</p>

<p>Alfred handed over the contents of his pockets.
The German officer glanced at the medals, and
made another motion. The seamen then pushed
them into the conning tower and the boys saw a
narrow flight of stairs to which they were directed,
the captain following.</p>

<p>Down into the bowels of a submarine! A warm,
peculiar, oily odor greeted them as they descended,
but the air was not at all unpleasant and breathing
was easy. Glancing about they saw confused
masses of mechanism, tanks, pipes, valves, levers,
wheels, clock-faced dial plates and other <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>contrivances,
all huddled together, with barely room to
pass from one place to another. Electric bulbs
were everywhere visible, lighting up the interior.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a slight tremor in the vessel,
indicating that some machinery was in motion.
Once at the bottom they stood there until the
seaman stepped forward and opened a small door
through which there was barely room to pass, and
he motioned them to enter. They did so, and
found themselves in a compartment which did
not seem to be more than five by six feet in size,
and even in this small space mechanism was noticed.
The moment the door closed they were in
total darkness.</p>

<p>"This is a nice place to get into," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"I wonder if they are going to keep us cooped
up like this without a light?" said Alfred.</p>

<p>After an interval of ten minutes a rumbling was
heard, which continued, a rhythmic motion followed
in unison with the sounds generated by the
machinery.</p>

<p>"That is the propeller," said the captain.</p>

<p>Voices were heard occasionally, but words could
not be distinguished. Confined as they were the
air seemed to be pure and in abundance at all
times, and while there was not the faintest signs
of closeness, there was an eternal monotony,&mdash;an
existence in which there was nothing to do but
breathe and think.</p>

<p>How long they were thus confined, without a
single thing to break the stillness, they could not
conceive. It seemed that hours had gone by, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>during
which time there was nothing to disturb them,
except the one steady whirr, broken occasionally
by some remark by one or the other.</p>

<p>Then came an unexpected hum of voices; the
machinery seemed to stop for a moment, and when
it was again continued it had a different melody.
The wheels, if such they were, seemed to turn
with smoothness, and they felt a sudden inclination
in the seats on which they were sitting.</p>

<p>"What do you suppose has happened?" asked
Ralph.</p>

<p>"The electric mechanism has been hitched to the
propeller, and, if I am not mistaken, we are going
down," said the captain.</p>

<p>"It did feel as though the forward end dipped
down a moment ago," said Alfred.</p>

<p>Another wait for a half-hour, and then a most
peculiar sound reached their ears. Simultaneously,
the ship seemed to stop and go on. Again
voices were heard, and the same reaction in the
hull of the submarine was felt, accompanied by
the dull noise, as before.</p>

<p>"They have just fired two torpedoes," said the
captain.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h2>THE TERRORS IN THE DARK ROOM OF AN UNDERSEA BOAT</h2>
<br />

<p>Imagine yourself locked in a compartment,
barely large enough to stretch yourself out
straight, in a ship under the sea, in total darkness,
knowing that should any one of the hundreds of
things within that ship go wrong, it would mean a
plunge to the bottom of the sea, beyond the help
of all human aid.</p>

<p>The danger to them was just as great while on
the surface of the water, for the guns mounted on
most vessels at this time, would make the submarine
a legitimate prey. One shot would be sufficient,
for ingenuity has not yet found a way to
quickly stop a leak in a submarine. Such a vessel,
when once struck, dare not dive, for that would
quickly fill the interior of the vessel with water.</p>

<p>It must, in that case, remain afloat, subject to
the hail of shot which must follow, their only salvation
in that event would be to hoist the white
flag. Few, if any submarine commanders have
done so, and even should that occur, it would not
prevent the hull from being riddled before the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>fact could be made known. The three-inch guns
mounted on most of the merchantmen, with an effective
range of three miles, could tear the weak
hull of a submarine to pieces at a single shot, and
all would be sure to go down before help could arrive
from the attacking steamer.</p>

<p>"The machinery seems to go very slow now,"
remarked Ralph.</p>

<p>"They may be cautiously coming to the top,"
replied the captain.</p>

<p>"Did you hear that peculiar noise?" said Alfred,
as he laid his hand on the captain's arm.</p>

<p>"That was plainly a shot from a ship," said the
captain.</p>

<p>"Do you think we could hear firing through all
this metal?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"Much easier than if we were on deck," answered
the captain.</p>

<p>"Why do you think so?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"Because water is a better conductor of sound
than air," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Do you mean that we can hear it better than
if the sound came through the air?" queried Alfred.</p>

<p>"The sound can be heard not only much plainer,
but also much sooner than through the air," answered
the captain.</p>

<p>"I think we are going down again," remarked
Ralph.</p>

<p>"No doubt of it," answered the captain quietly.</p>

<p>"Do you think they have hit us?" eagerly inquired
Ralph.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>The captain did not reply. Alfred reached his
hand forward and grasped the captain's hand.
"You needn't fear to tell us if you think we are
going down for the last time."</p>

<p>"You are a brave boy!" said the captain. "I do
not know what to answer. I have never been on
a submarine when it was struck by a bullet; but
it seemed to me as though something struck our
shell, and if it did there is no help for us, for
the devils would gloat on our misery, and would
not think of liberating us, to give us a chance for
our lives."</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes elapsed before the captain continued:
"This gives me some hope."</p>

<p>"What is it?" quickly inquired Ralph.</p>

<p>"We are still on an even keel," was the answer.</p>

<p>"Does that mean that we are safe?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"Yes, if the shell of the submarine had been
pierced, and we were really going down it would
not be long before the hull would lose its equipoise
and turn around, or it might stand on end, due to
the distribution of water throughout the interior,"
was the reply.</p>

<p>"I understand now," said Alfred. "You think
we are still floating, but do you think we are on
the surface?"</p>

<p>"We are, undoubtedly, submerged, for it is evident
that the smooth motion of the propeller comes
from the electric motors and not from the internal
combustion engines, which are used solely while
running on the surface," remarked the captain.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>After hours more of interminable waiting, they
heard a noise close at hand. With something like
a snap the door opened and a flood of light
streamed into their compartment from the electric
bulbs without, and, looking up, they saw, at the
ceiling of their room, a small electric bulb.</p>

<p>"Why is it we didn't hunt for that?" whispered
Ralph, looking up.</p>

<p>"But I can't see any way to turn it on," said
Alfred.</p>

<p>"That lights only from the outside," said the
attendant. "Here is something to eat," he continued
in English.</p>

<p>"What time is it?" asked the captain.</p>

<p>"Half past one o'clock," was the reply.</p>

<p>They had been in that cramped prison pen five
hours.</p>

<p>"Did you torpedo another ship?" queried the
captain.</p>

<p>"We tried to; but a torpedo boat destroyer came
up too close," he answered.</p>

<p>"How many shots did it fire?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"Two," was the laconic reply.</p>

<p>"How long have we been submerged?"</p>

<p>"Two hours," answered the man. "As I came
down the report from the periscope showed a clear
sea, and we are now about to resume surface travel
and repair one of the periscopes."</p>

<p>The boys glanced at each other and at the captain.</p>

<p>"Yes," remarked the captain, "that was a
pretty close call."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>The attendant left them without closing the
door, and as the prisoners glanced about, nothing
was to be seen of the stairway which led to the
conning tower. Men were noticed at work, each
being stationed at some particular machine or
set of machinery. Then, with a bang, something
like a trap door swung aside and the stairway
was revealed, and a peculiar light streamed in
through the hatch opening.</p>

<p>"It's the sun," said Ralph, in ecstacy.</p>

<p>"I never thought we'd see that again," said Alfred,
almost overcome.</p>

<p>"May we walk around?" asked the captain, as
he approached an under officer.</p>

<p>"There isn't much chance for exercising here,"
was the reply, "but I think you will be given top
liberty after awhile," replied the man.</p>

<p>"Will they let us go?" asked Ralph eagerly.</p>

<p>"No; he didn't say that; he meant they would
give us liberty to walk on the top deck for a short
time," replied the captain.</p>

<p>Shortly thereafter the lieutenant in command
of the submarine appeared at the foot of the
hatchway and informed the captain that they
were at liberty to ascend. Never did the sun appear
to be more beautiful or inviting, although
there was a perceptible chill in the atmosphere.
The submarine was moving along at a speed of
twelve knots an hour. Four men were engaged
in taking down a bent and partially ruptured periscope
tube.</p>

<p>The captain glanced at it and drew the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>attention
of the boys to its structure. It was the tall
periscope that received the shot, which struck it
about four feet from the top.</p>

<p>"It must have been hit on the water line," said
the captain, addressing the lieutenant.</p>

<p>The latter merely nodded, but made no remarks
in response.</p>

<p>They were permitted to walk to and fro for an
hour, when the order came to descend, and they
again entered their prison. As before, they were
subjected to total darkness, but there was no necessity
for this deprivation, and it is not clear why an
enemy should treat prisoners in this manner, for
such actions necessarily leave only resentments
and do no good whatever.</p>

<p>It was a long, long, dreary afternoon and night,
which they tried to while away in sleeping, for conversation,
under the circumstances, soon became
irksome. When they awoke, or, rather, when all
were again alert and felt as though the night must
have passed, the captain was the first to break the
silence, as he said:</p>

<p>"We have been resting quietly for more than an
hour, I should say, probably lying in wait in one
of the steamer lanes for new victims."</p>

<p>"Isn't it likely we are on the bottom of the
ocean? Don't they go down sometimes and wait
there?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"Yes; but not in deep water, such as is found
in this bay. At no place is it less than 150 fathoms,
and in the central portion, where our ship
went down it is more than 2,000 fathoms."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>"Why, that's two miles deep, or more," said Alfred.</p>

<p>"Yes, the Bay of Biscay is one of the deep holes
in the Atlantic coast line of Europe. The average
depth of the Irish Sea, St. George Channel, the
English Channel and the North Sea is only about
250 feet, and there are thousands of places in the
North Sea, particularly, like the Dogger Banks,
where the water is not more than a hundred feet
deep," remarked the captain.</p>

<p>"Then the submarines could easily rest on the
bottom if the depth is not more than one hundred
feet?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"Submarines have, in several cases, gone down
as far as 200 feet below the surface, but it is at
a great risk," said the captain.</p>

<p>"You mean risk from the pressure of the
water?" said Ralph.</p>

<p>"Yes," was the reply.</p>

<p>"What would be the pressure of the water on
a submarine at that depth?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"Pressure is calculated on the square inch of
surface; for every twenty-eight inches the pressure
is equal to one pound. If, therefore, 200 is
multiplied by 12 and then divided by 28, the quotient
will represent the number of pounds on each
square inch," answered the captain.</p>

<p>"Why multiply 200 by twelve?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"Because there are twelve inches in a foot,"
said the captain.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; I didn't happen to think of it; well,
200 by 12,&mdash;that's 2,400, and divided by 28, is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>"Eighty-five," interrupted Alfred. "Well,
that's not very much."</p>

<p>"Quite true," rejoined the captain; "but how
many square inches are there in a square foot?"</p>

<p>"One hundred and forty-four," replied Alfred.</p>

<p>"Then, eighty-five times one hundred and forty-four
makes quite a sum," continued the captain.</p>

<p>"Whew,&mdash;&mdash;" said Ralph with a half whistle in
his tone, "why, if I have made it out right, it's
over 12,000 pounds. No wonder it isn't safe to
stay down very long, if at all, at that depth."</p>

<p>"I have often wondered how it is that the submarine
could rest on the bottom or come up at
will," said Alfred.</p>

<p>"All submarines are lighter than the water in
which they float," answered the captain. "They
are provided with tanks holding compressed air.
Now, in order to submerge, the only thing necessary
is to permit enough water to flow into special
tanks within the submarine, until the combined
weight of the water, hull and mechanism,
is the same as the amount of water that the ship
displaces. If an added quantity of water is now
added, it will go down, and remain under water
until the air in the compressed tanks is used to
force out a quantity of water from the special
tanks."</p>

<p>"But is that the only way they can go down?"
asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"Oh, no; a submarine can submerge without
doing that, but in such a case power must be used,"
answered the captain.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>"What! push it down by power?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"Exactly; these vessels have fins, the same as
fish, so arranged that if they are properly turned
and the ship moves forward, it will dive, and continue
to go down at an angle as long as the fins
are properly set. If the vessel should stop moving
the submarine would come to the top, because
it is lighter than the water," responded the captain.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h2>SOME OF THE MYSTERIES OF A SUBMARINE</h2>
<br />

<p>With a click the door of their prison cabin
opened and a seaman informed them that their
breakfast was ready. They passed through the
narrow door, and edged their way along a tortuous
path that led to the rear, where they entered
what might be called a miniature galley, on one
side of which was a narrow shelf containing food
of various descriptions.</p>

<p>There was room only for the attendant to pass
while they were seated. An abundance of the best
food was served, cereals, and even fruit, forming
part of the menu. Each of these vessels carry
from twenty-two to thirty men, but there were in
sight in the dining room only ten, besides the cook
and waiter.</p>

<p>After the meal, the captain inquired of the officer
at the main hatch whether they would be permitted
to go on deck.</p>

<p>"I have no orders," he replied.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the boys had an opportunity to investigate
the mysteries of the interior, for it was
well lighted.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>"What are those long drums ahead there?"
asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"I think they are the casings which carry the
torpedoes," replied the captain. "If you look
beyond you will see the rear ends of the tubes
which receive the torpedoes. The cylinders in
sight hold the torpedoes until they are ready to
be placed in the tubes and shot out of them."</p>

<p>"You have orders to go on deck," the under officer
at the bottom of the hatch now informed them.</p>

<p>This was an invitation to which they quickly responded.
They ascended, and found the sun hidden,
and the sea about them calm. Glancing across
the broad expanse of water, not a sail was in sight.
It was a cold, gray morning, ordinarily uninviting
weather, but after the house of confinement it was
enjoyed to the fullest extent.</p>

<p>"Down below!" shouted a voice.</p>

<p>The boys looked around in surprise, for they
had been on deck less than ten minutes.</p>

<p>"Clear the deck!" shouted the same voice. The
boys, with the captain, were hustled forward into
the conning tower, and the iron door closed with
a bang. The boys were permitted to stop only
long enough to see two men turn eight swinging
bolts, which hung about the margins of the doors,
and quickly screw them up against the jamb.</p>

<p>The lieutenant was leaning over a narrow table
on which was a chart, and gazing through a crystal-covered
port in the front of the conning tower.
A bell tinkled, machinery began to turn and impart
its vibration to the ship, and it was again a living
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>thing. It glided forward with the same rhythmic
noises for a half-hour, and then two bells were
heard.</p>

<p>The character of the sounds from the machinery
changed; they seemed to move forward with less
effort, and as they felt the same inclination in the
motion of the ship, all were now satisfied that she
was again submerging. Fortunately, they were
not confined to their room, and, although no verbal
orders had been given for the various operations
required to handle the vessel, the prisoners had an
opportunity to judge of what was going on.</p>

<p>Thus, when the signal was given to change the
motive power from the internal combustion engines
to electricity, they could see the engine stop,
and an attendant shift the clutch which engaged
the electric motors. A dial swinging over a card
alongside a pair of levers indicated the direction
of movement, while another gave not only the inclination
of the ship, but its speed as well.</p>

<p>These things were very fascinating to the boys,
but their attention was now attracted to a still
more interesting scene. A bell forward gave two
short, quick snaps. Four men sprang forward and
stood at attention, two on each side of the tube at
the right of the hold.</p>

<p>"The indicator shows that the submarine is
turning," said the captain. The boys watched the
indicator; it had swung around almost half-way.</p>

<p>"There,&mdash;look at the inclinometer," said Ralph.
"It is moving upward&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ting! ting!" Two more sharp bells forward.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>The cylinder was off the torpedo, and it lay before
them exposed.</p>

<p>Three bells more; and now there was feverish
haste. An oval door in the wall ahead was swung
open, revealing a round, black hole.</p>

<p>"That is the torpedo tube," said the captain
quietly.</p>

<p>The torpedo was moved back three feet, and
then again carried forward on its truck so that
the end of the torpedo entered the tube.</p>

<p>One bell more. The torpedo moved into the
tube, the breech block, which in this case was the
oval door, closed, and the crew stood at attention.
While thus waiting the boys glanced at the inclinometer
and at the direction indicator.</p>

<p>"See it swing back and forth," said Alfred. "It
seems to act queerly."</p>

<p>"Not at all," replied the captain. "Evidently
we are chasing a ship which is zig-zagging, as we
did, for the direction dial is constantly moving."</p>

<p>While thus conversing they were startled by the
signal of four bells. One of the men, reaching forward,
touched a button, and the signal could be
heard in the conning tower. That was, evidently,
to inform the commander there that all was in
readiness. Everything was expectancy now. The
ship still manoeuvered.</p>

<p>Then, without a warning of any kind, there was
a singular dull sound, which seemed to shake the
submarine from stem to stern.</p>

<p>"They have fired it," said Alfred.</p>

<p>"And they are putting in another one."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>"If I am not mistaken it is the last one they
have," suggested the captain.</p>

<p>"Why do you think so?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"I notice that all the cylinders with the open
ends are without torpedoes, and you will notice
that the one they are now putting in is the last
one with the closed end," responded the captain.</p>

<p>"I am glad they haven't any more of them,"
said Ralph.</p>

<p>Three bells again sounded; the officer at the
gun responded, and during the next two minutes
of suspense, the boys were quiet, waiting for the
next shot. It soon came; the ship shook as before,
the breach block opened, the shell behind the
torpedo was extracted, the door closed and the
men stood at attention.</p>

<p>When the officer, who had handled the torpedoes,
walked down the steps from the conning
tower, the boys noticed him shake his head sadly.</p>

<p>"Did you notice that?" asked the captain.</p>

<p>"Do you mean the way he shook his head?" said
Alfred.</p>

<p>"Yes; I am curious to get your views about that
action of the officer," remarked the captain.</p>

<p>"That is, why he shook his head?" interjected
Ralph.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the captain. "Do you think
he looked discouraged because the shot failed in
its mission, or because it went home successfully?
That is the problem."</p>

<p>The boys were quiet for a few moments. Ralph
was the first to speak: "Well, I'll bet the torpedo
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>didn't hit the ship, and he feels cut up over it, as
it was the last one they had."</p>

<p>"I don't agree with you," rejoined Alfred. "It
struck the ship and sunk it, and the fellow feels so
badly about it that he shook his head the way he
did when he thought of the suffering it caused.
Don't you agree with me?" said Alfred, addressing
the captain.</p>

<p>The captain could not repress a slight laugh as:
he answered: "I must confess you advance good
arguments in both directions; but really, I am of
the opinion that either torpedo didn't get in its
work."</p>

<p>"Why do you think the first one failed?"</p>

<p>"If the first one had succeeded, they would not
have shot the second, would they?" replied the
captain.</p>

<p>"No; I don't think they would, seeing they had
only one more left," remarked Ralph. "But why
do you think the last one was no more successful?"</p>

<p>"I infer it from the following circumstances:
It takes, on an average, a minute for a torpedo to
reach its mark, after it leaves the torpedo tube.
The officer in the tower is in a position where he
can see the effect of the shot. If the torpedo
struck, however favorable the blow, it would take
at least fifteen or twenty minutes for the ship to
go down. Sometimes the bulkheads will keep the
ship afloat an hour or more. In fact, there are
records of ships which have been torpedoed, that
were actually towed into harbors and saved," answered
the captain.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>"But I do not see how that is any sign that the
torpedo missed," replied Alfred inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Probably you did not notice the period that
elapsed after the last shot, and the time the officer
came down the tower hatch?" remarked the captain.</p>

<p>"No, I did not observe," replied Alfred.</p>

<p>"You remember, do you not, that as soon as the
last torpedo was launched, the officer went up into
the conning tower, and that within a minute, or
not exceeding two minutes, he again came down
the stairway, and shook his head in such a disconsolate
manner?" continued the captain.</p>

<p>"Well, yes; you may be right in that," responded
Alfred.</p>

<p>"Then, I inferred this," said the captain, "that
the lieutenant had had ample opportunity to observe
whether or not the shot went home, and, as
it had not landed, he reported to the officer the
failure. If the shot had struck he would have
known it before the officer left the conning tower
to come down. Do you get my idea?" asked the
captain.</p>

<p>"That seems to answer the question, to my
mind, that it wasn't a hit," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"Well, it doesn't quite satisfy me," replied Alfred.
"The lieutenant might have told him that
the shot hit the ship, and that it was going down,
and that's what made him feel so badly about it."</p>

<p>The captain could not help feeling amused at
Alfred's argument, as he replied: "I must admit
that your view is logical, and I am also willing to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>assent that the question is one, which, in the absence
of actual knowledge, could be settled in one
way only."</p>

<p>"How is that?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"By knowing the mental condition and attitude
of the officer who came down the hatchway. If he
happened to be a humane person he would regret
the loss of life, and show it, probably, by his actions.
On the other hand, if he should be devoid
of the finer feelings, and be a mere slave to duty,
it is more than likely that he would shake his head
discouragingly, to learn that the torpedo failed
in its mission," was the captain's final word on the
subject.</p>

<p>"Now that they are out of torpedoes, what do
you suppose they will do?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"Go home; I suppose," replied Alfred.</p>

<p>"Unless they have a base somewhere on the
coast," replied the captain.</p>

<p>"Where is the most likely place for such a
base?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"That is the enigma, of course. It has been believed
that the Germans have a base somewhere
along the northern coast of Spain," said the captain.</p>

<p>"What are the reasons for thinking so?" asked
Alfred.</p>

<p>"One of them is that some of the Spaniards are
said to be more or less friendly to the Germans,
and, furthermore, there are few ports or harbors
on the north coast, hence the shipping to Spain in
the southern waters of the Bay of Biscay is very
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>small, a condition which would help to keep a base
along the coast line at one or more points."</p>

<p>"But we ought to know in the next day or two
whether they have such a base," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"Yes; it will be the opportunity now for us to
make some observation which will tell us whether
we are going to Germany, or not," said the captain
with a grin.</p>

<p>Situated, as they were, below decks, with no instruments
but the direction indicator, and the inclinometer
in sight, it was impossible to judge of
the direction they were going, for it was evident
that the submarine was now moving ahead at full
speed.</p>

<p>"It will be, probably, twenty-four hours before
we are able to get any information as to our destination,"
said the captain.</p>

<p>"Do you intend to ask some of the men?" inquired
Alfred.</p>

<p>"No; that would be fruitless. It is not at all
likely they will venture any information upon a
subject of that character," replied the captain.</p>

<p>"Then how would it be possible to learn anything
about where we are going?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"We are now somewhere in the Bay of Biscay,
and I infer that we must be about a hundred and
fifty miles from the Spanish coast. To reach that
at the rate we are going, would take at least ten
hours, for I assume that the vessel is capable of
at least ten miles an hour. Then, we must take
into consideration the possible meeting with <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>vessels,
in which case we must submerge, and thus
go much slower," said the captain.</p>

<p>"Then, if they have a base anywhere along the
coast we ought to be there before tomorrow at
this time?" ventured Alfred.</p>

<p>"That is exactly what I mean," answered the
captain.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h2>GROPING THROUGH THE ENGLISH CHANNEL</h2>
<br />

<p>There was a steady pulsation of the engines
during the entire afternoon without cessation until
five o'clock, when the submarine submerged and
continued under water for an hour. The three
captives had now learned a great many of the
manoeuvers incident to the diving operations, the
signals accompanying each action, and studied
with the greatest diligence and care the direction
indicator and inclinometer.</p>

<p>"I have been noticing the indicator for the last
hour," said Ralph, "and it didn't change once.
Are we going due north?"</p>

<p>"The indicator that you see is not for the purpose
of showing the points of the compass, but to
tell whether or not there is a turning movement in
the ship. If, for instance, the rudder should be
turned to starboard or to port, the dial would
swing in such a position as to show how much of a
turn has been made, and no more," responded the
captain.</p>

<p>"Suppose then, that after making a quarter
turn, the ship should again go ahead on a straight
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>line, what would happen to the dial?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"In that case the dial would again indicate that
by coming back to its original position,&mdash;or, in
other words, the dial would show that the ship
had then assumed a new direction of sailing, and
if it again changed to the right or to the left the
indicator would reveal this to the observer," remarked
the captain.</p>

<p>"I wish we had a compass," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, they have taken our watches
and pocket compasses," said the captain. "We
may contrive, later on, to get a glimpse of the
steering compass."</p>

<p>"Do you know where it is?" eagerly inquired
Alfred.</p>

<p>"The navigating officer's instrument is in the
conning tower, but it is usual, too, to have a similar
instrument below, and I am sure it is located
to the left of the cook's galley. It would not be
safe, however, for either of us to be spying around
in that quarter," responded the captain.</p>

<p>That night they were again locked in their narrow
apartment. As they had been provided with
a good meal it was not such an unpleasant experience,
and they were also comforted by the feeling
that the submarine was now engaged in a no more
perilous duty than trying to reach some port.</p>

<p>That night was followed by a trying day of
waiting. Singularly, they had not been permitted
to ascend the hatchway stairs since the first day
of their capture.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>"A glance at the sun would be enough to tell us
the direction," remarked the captain after they
left the table at the lunch hour.</p>

<p>"I suppose they are keeping us down here for
that purpose," suggested Alfred.</p>

<p>"I have thought," replied the captain, "that the
very fact of keeping us in ignorance of the direction
they are going is the best indication that we
are making for a concealed base."</p>

<p>When they retired the second night the captain
remarked: "It is now plain to my mind that we are
on the way to Germany, or, possibly, to a base
somewhere at a greater distance than Spain."</p>

<p>"How long would it take to make the trip to
Germany?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"If we circled the British Isles and came in by
way of Norway, it would mean a run of 1,400 miles.
To go by way of the Channel would be about 800
miles. It would make but little difference in point
of time," answered the captain.</p>

<p>"Why wouldn't it take longer to travel 1,400
miles?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"Because on the long route we would be able to
travel four-fifths of the way on the surface, and
would not have to avoid mines and nets. The
Channel route is a dangerous one, requiring the
utmost caution," said the captain.</p>

<p>The second morning Alfred was outside, as
usual, consulting the instruments, when a voice
remarked in response to an inquiry: "48, 10." He
paid no attention to it at the time, but later on, in
a conversation, remarked to the captain:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>"Some one in the conning tower, this morning,
said '48, 10.' What do you suppose he meant by
that?"</p>

<p>"Glad you remembered that. Are you sure the
figures you give are correct?" asked the captain
eagerly.</p>

<p>"Sure of it," was Alfred's reply.</p>

<p>"Then we are near the English Channel. Good;
I am glad to know that. Did you hear them refer
to any other figures?" asked the captain.</p>

<p>"What would the other figures be?" asked
Ralph.</p>

<p>"Of course, I can only guess. The figures you
have given me unquestionably represent forty-eight
degrees and ten minutes north latitude.
What interests me most is to get our position east
and west," said the captain.</p>

<p>"About what longitude are we in?" asked
Ralph.</p>

<p>"If we are less than five degrees west we must
be in the English Channel, and it would appear
that they are taking the shortest route. If we
should be seven or eight degrees west I should regard
it as a pretty sure symptom that we are going
to encircle the British Isles," remarked the captain.</p>

<p>Late that afternoon Ralph rushed into their little
cabin and said:</p>

<p>"I have an idea that I can tell you the direction
we are going."</p>

<p>"Have you heard anything?" asked the captain.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>"Not a word," answered Ralph. "I have just
made an observation," he continued, laughing.</p>

<p>"That's good," responded the captain. "I
think we are sailing north by west."</p>

<p>"You are wrong," replied Ralph; "we are going
due east."</p>

<p>"Are you sure?" asked the captain, exhibiting
unusual interest in the news. "How did you find
it out?"</p>

<p>"I saw the sun," said Ralph with a chuckle.</p>

<p>"How and where did you see it?" asked Alfred,
incredulously.</p>

<p>"Well, I didn't exactly see the sun, but I saw a
streak that came from the sun," was the reply.</p>

<p>"That's just as good," responded the captain.
"Where did you see it?"</p>

<p>"I was at the indicator when an officer went up
and the hatch was raised. As he didn't push it all
the way down I had an idea he might soon return,
so I moved up and stood between the twin tanks to
the right of the steps. When the officer raised
the hatch a streak of sunlight went right across
the under side at the corner of the door, and I
knew it couldn't come in at the front port hole,"
said Ralph, with a glow of pleasure in the discovery.</p>

<p>The captain shook his head slowly, as he said:
"I am afraid this will mean an additional source
of worry to all of us; it is bad enough to be locked
up and subjected to the guns of vessels and warships,
but it will be doubly hazardous to pass
through the mine fields, and avoid the nets."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>"Do you know anything about them, and how
and where they are located?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have a pretty good knowledge of their
location, and how to avoid them, although they
constantly change the nets, or provide new safety
outlets," said the captain.</p>


<div class="img"><a name="imagep073" id="imagep073"></a>
<a href="images/imagep073.png">
<img border="0" src="images/imagep073.png" width="70%" alt="The Steel Nets" /></a><br />
<p class="cen" style="margin-top: .2em;"><i>The Steel Nets</i><span class="totoi"><a href="#toi">ToList</a></span></p>
</div>

<p>"What do you mean by safety outlets?" asked
Alfred.</p>

<p>"Immense steel nets are stretched across the
straits from Calais to Dover, two lines, in fact,
between which the vessels plying between England
and France go to and fro in safety. Furthermore,
war vessels guard these nets on both sides, so that
it would be a difficult matter to get near the nets,"
said the captain.</p>

<p>"But submarines do seem to get through somewhere;
do they not?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"Yes; owing to their ability to make the trip
under water, and taking advantage of the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>darkness,
it is sometimes the case that they get through
without being entangled in the nets," he replied.</p>

<p>"But how do the ships that sail along the Channel
get through?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"That is just what I was referring to when I
spoke of safety outlets. At a certain point there
is an opening through the nets at one side,
through which vessels can pass into the line between
the two wire cordons. The opening in the
other line of nets is not directly opposite, but a
mile or so off to one side, so that in order to get
to the opening in the other nets, it is necessary for
the ship to sail along in the safety zone between
the two nets, and make a turn at right angles to
get out through the second opening. That method
has been found to be most effective, and is called
the safety lane," responded the captain.</p>

<p>They were now in or near the most widely
traveled part of the ocean on the western front of
the continent. Thousands of ships pass and repass
that zone which reaches from the southern
part of Ireland to the western coast of France,
and it was remarkable that the submarine was
able to move along up to this time on the surface
without being detected.</p>

<p>Before the sun had gone down that night, however,
they were compelled to submerge twice, and
then the mantle of night shrouded the vessel and
it moved along with more boldness. On this the
fourth night of captivity, they were not locked
in their prison.</p>

<p>"I cannot account for it," said the captain.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>"Possibly the commander has some little human
sympathy left, and does not want to drown us like
rats in a cage."</p>

<p>Neither the captain nor the boys slept much that
night. They were too much occupied with constantly
watching the manoeuvers necessary on the
part of the commander and his crew to prevent
detection as they passed up the Channel.</p>

<p>"I have spent years on the Channel as a navigating
officer and in charge of various types of
ships in the merchant service, as well as on our
own naval vessels, and I know, probably, better
than the lieutenant in charge of the submarine,
what the dangers are. It is my belief that the lieutenant
has come over this course before, and probably
knows a safe, or measurably safe route, and
has taken the chances of returning, but no one,
however skilful a navigator he may be, can be sure
of making exactly the same course twice. The
tides may be against him; he may be out of his
reckonings hundreds of feet, and that is too big
a margin, where a hundred feet in width is the
limit through which his vessel may pass in safety."</p>

<p>The captain thus, in general terms, set forth
the perils of the route that the commander of the
submarine had taken, and stated also, very plainly,
that they must now be prepared to meet the greatest
of all dangers. Sleep, therefore, could not be
considered.</p>

<p>The long and weary night at last came to an
end, and the appetizing odors of the morning meal
were wafted to them. Their toilets were <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>exceedingly
simple affairs, a small cake of soap, warm
water, and a long towel serving for the three.
They had no trouble in dressing, for their clothing
had not been removed. They were obliged to
dispense with the bath, for, although all these
boats are provided with comforts of that kind,
none of them was available to the captain and the
boys, and they did not ask that any privileges be
extended to them.</p>

<p>No sooner had breakfast been served than the
machinery began to slow down until finally it
ceased. Not a perceptible motion was now observed.
A pulsator or two were at work, and a
slight rumble due to the action of the dynamo came
to their ears.</p>

<p>"I suppose we are now on the bottom," suggested
Ralph.</p>

<p>"Yes; during the daytime it will be necessary to
keep quiet. Even the periscope may reveal our
presence," remarked the captain.</p>

<p>A little information as to the activities of the
crew during these periods of rest may be interesting.
Idleness breeds discontent and mischief. It
is upon the principle that constant work encourages
contentment and makes for efficiency, that
the Germans require the continued activity which
was shown by the occupants of the submarine.</p>

<p>The vessel was manned by twenty-seven officers
and men. The personnel being as follows: A lieutenant,
a sub-lieutenant, two under or petty officers,
a physician, a cook and two oilers, two first-class
machinists, and seventeen helpers, or <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>seamen,
although it was evident, as the captain expressed
it, that few of the helpers had seen much
sea duty.</p>

<p>While it is customary to divide the duties on
shipboard into three watches, during the period
of twenty-four hours, so as to give each squad a
period of service every day at a different period,
it would be difficult to carry out the same regulations
on board a ship of this character.</p>

<p>The captain said: "I notice that they have practically
two watches, one taking up the duty from
midday until twelve at night, and the other from
midnight to noon. Yesterday, I noticed the same
shift that was on duty in the morning continued at
work all the afternoon, so it is possible that every
three or four days shift No. 1, which works from
noon to midnight, will be changed so that for the
next four days the time for their services will be
from midnight to noon."</p>

<p>Attention is called to this method of doing duty
so that the reader may understand certain events
which will be referred to later.</p>

<p>The personnel of the shifts was also changed at
intervals so that while the lieutenant during one
shift would have at work a certain machinist and
petty officer, during the next or second shift thereafter
another machinist or petty officer would be
on duty. In this manner all became efficient, for
they had the opportunity afforded of being drilled
and handled by different combinations of men and
assistants.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h2>CAUGHT IN THE DEEP SEA NETS</h2>
<br />

<p>The starting of the heavy machinery was sufficient
indication that night had come. They were
now going up and at an angle which was very perceptible.
The boys had become quite expert in detecting
certain activities, as they tried in every
way to understand the use of the signals. One
thing was certain; two sets of bells were brought
into play as the signal for changing the motive
power. The first signal, three bells followed by
two more, was invariably the necessary preparation
for this event.</p>

<p>A highly pitched bell next gave the signal to
stop the gasoline engines and a deep-toned bell indicated
the coupling of the electric motor. Occasionally
a new set of signals would resound,
which they tried to figure out. During the night
Alfred thought he had found the key.</p>

<p>"Did you notice the big hand wheel on the side
of the upright tank, which we pass as we go into
the dining room?" he remarked.</p>

<p>"That is connected with a large valve," said
the captain. "What did you observe?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>"Well, did you ever notice that before they rang
the shrill bell four times we always have heard a
whistle?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"Why, I have heard the bell ring four times on
several occasions without the whistle," contended
Ralph.</p>

<p>"So you have, but it was always after the four
rings that followed the whistle. A little while ago
I was near the tank, and I heard the whistle. The
attendant sprang to the wheel, and when the four
rings came he turned the wheel around twice.
When the four next rings came (without the whistle,
of course), he quickly turned it back again,"
said Alfred.</p>

<p>"That is the submerging tank," said the captain.
"I see you are rapidly learning how to handle
a submarine," and he laughed at the eagerness
of the boys trying to conquer the details of signaling.</p>

<p>During that night there was hardly a half-hour
but some movement or other was indicated by the
bells. They submerged, halted, rose to the surface,
steamed at full speed, and in one or two instances
it was evident from the sudden stopping
that the submarine had to reverse.</p>

<p>This constantly kept them alert, and while engaged
in conversation late in the morning, they
were thrown forward on their seats with a motion
that indicated a collision with something which
was not very rigid, for there was no concussion
such as usually accompanies the contact of the hull
of a vessel with a hard object.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>The boys looked at the captain in astonishment.
They could now feel the propeller pulling in the
opposite direction, only to be brought back again
with the same springy collision, as when it had
gone forward and first struck the strange obstacle.</p>

<p>The captain's face paled, and the boys plied him
with questions as they saw his perturbed countenance.</p>

<p>"What do you think it is?" asked Ralph, as he
saw the anxious seamen, and the second officer
rushing about shouting orders, while one of them
seized the main valve wheel and turned it.</p>

<p>"We are caught in one of the steel nets," said
the captain quietly.</p>

<p>The boys' faces grew deadly pale. They knew
what such a calamity meant. Few, if any of the
submarines caught in the nets, ever escaped. The
boys, while they did not know this, were, in a measure,
aware of the great danger to submarines from
this source. They were alarmed particularly on
account of the serious manner in which the captain
acted the moment the first impact took place.</p>

<p>The captain now arose, followed by the boys,
and marched through the narrow passageway toward
the lieutenant who was leaning over one of
the air compressors.</p>

<p>"Is there anything we can do to help you?"
asked the captain.</p>

<p>The lieutenant looked up and replied: "We can
do nothing but change the trim of the ship. Everything
portable in the stern must be moved forward.
Your assistance will be appreciated," was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>the reply, an answer that was in marked contrast
with his former demeanor.</p>

<p>The lieutenant then quickly detailed four men,
who, together with the captain and the two boys,
were directed what articles to carry forward. In
this exercise they found many unexpected nooks
and turns. The articles removed were mostly
ship's supplies, stores, boxes of canned goods,
drugs in cases, and a lot of tubing. Some of the
boxes must have contained machinery, or mechanical
parts, for they were very heavy.</p>

<p>They were engaged at this work for fully an
hour, and the task proved a difficult one, for the
passageways were narrow and tortuous, and sometimes
it was necessary to move through narrow
alleys which ran almost directly across the ship.
Every available bit of space is utilized in these
vessels for the operating machinery.</p>

<p>The entire length of the submarine was 126 feet,
and the material had to be carried a distance of
about eighty feet. The lieutenant was in the stern
portion, pointing out the articles which should be
taken, while the sub-lieutenant directed the placing
of them in the bow.</p>

<p>The captain and Ralph were just depositing a
load in the hold near the bow, when a peculiar
noise was heard, resembling a scraping, rasping
sound. Before they had time to turn around, or
move from their positions, the rear end of the submarine
seemed to swing upward, bringing down
and scattering among the machinery a choice lot
of boxes and parcels.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>A groan followed. Something peculiar had happened,&mdash;a
thing unique in the annals of submarining.
The vessel, after the peculiar motion, was
quiet, but it was lying at an angle of forty-five degrees.
The seamen and the captain hurriedly
tried to move back in order to discover what had
happened and from whom the groans proceeded.</p>

<p>It was hard work, and dangerous, too. Alfred
was found pinned between the tanks, and temporarily
held by several cases, but, fortunately, he
was not hurt in the least.</p>

<p>Directly forward of the conning tower stairway
the captain now noticed an object, and upon examination
it was found to be the lieutenant, who had
been thrown a distance of more than thirty feet
through the tangled machinery. He was unconscious.</p>

<p>The physician was soon by his side, and a frightful
gash was observed on the right side of the officer's
face. Two men nearby were groaning. One
had a broken leg, and the other several contusions
about the head, and, owing to their crippled condition,
it was just as much of a task to lower the
bodies down into the inclined hold as to walk upward.</p>

<p>This was finally accomplished, and the lieutenant,
with the two injured men, were landed in the
long compartment, which served as the dining
room.</p>

<p>The sub-lieutenant was found pinned by some
boxes between two stanchions, which had not been
distributed and placed within the compartments.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>The seaman soon released him; he was not injured
in any way, and now that the lieutenant was in a
serious condition, the command devolved on him.</p>

<p>"That motion, if anything, will disentangle us
from the nets," said the captain, addressing the
sub-lieutenant. The latter did not reply, but
turned on the captain with a frown.</p>

<p>"Your opinion is not requested!" he said in a
terse manner.</p>

<p>The captain made a quiet bow and moved toward
their small room, the boys following.</p>

<p>"I am sorry that fellow is in command," said
Alfred. "I never liked him from the first."</p>

<p>"I'll bet we were locked up by that fellow's orders,
for I don't believe the lieutenant had anything
to do with it," remarked Ralph. The captain
nodded his head, as he replied: "I knew that
from the first day."</p>

<p>"I'd like to get ahead of him some way," said
Alfred.</p>

<p>The captain looked at the boys for a few moments,
then quietly put his hands on their arms,
as he said: "Getting ahead, or getting even,
doesn't pay, as a rule; but I have known where a
few have been able to overcome a great many, as
a duty, for that is what makes men strong."</p>

<p>Alfred's eyes fairly bulged, as he gazed at the
captain. "Isn't it a duty to capture this submarine?"</p>

<p>The captain leaned forward and held up a warning
hand. Ralph rose up and glanced around.
"Why can't we do it?" he asked.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>"There is only one thing lacking; yes, it has
been in my mind from the first moment we came
aboard, but we cannot do it without weapons.
With them in our possession we might succeed.
Why, if we could have had them this afternoon it
would have been an ideal time to make the attempt,"
said the captain.</p>

<p>"I have something to tell you," said Alfred, as
he lowered his voice.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked the captain.</p>

<p>"I know where there is a box of revolvers," he
replied.</p>

<p>"Where?" asked the captain, agitated visibly.</p>

<p>"Do you remember the two big upright drums
which I was pinned against when the ship went
up?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the captain.</p>

<p>"Well, one of the boxes broke open when it came
down the passageway, and when I saw what was in
it I pushed it way under the base of the tank on the
left side," said Alfred.</p>

<p>"The revolvers are all right, but we may have
some trouble in getting cartridges," replied the
captain. "But wait," he continued, "I am sure I
carried cases of them down the passageway."</p>

<p>"If I am not mistaken, there are several boxes
near there,&mdash;rather long, slim boxes, are they
not?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"Yes; with a red label on the corner," interrupted
Ralph. "I can put my hands on a box any
minute."</p>

<p>"Then you are with me and will carefully follow
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>out my instructions?" inquired the captain, looking
at them intently.</p>

<p>"We will follow you in whatever you ask us to
do," replied Ralph.</p>

<p>"You must remember that the business we are
about to engage in means life or death. Once begun
we cannot go back. We have no line of retreat.
While it is most hazardous, the feat would
be a wonderful one," said the captain.</p>

<p>"No; we are not afraid. Both of us have been
in some dangerous places and have come out all
right. We have confidence in you," said Alfred
slowly and deliberately.</p>

<p>"Thank you for that," replied the captain.
"We must begin the preparations at once, for at
the present time when all is confusion we can get
the opportunities that may not be offered later
on."</p>

<p>"The boat seems to move," said Alfred.</p>

<p>A perceptible swaying motion was now observed.
The vessel was still lying at the inclined
position heretofore described. As they were about
to crawl out of their cabin, they heard the voice of
the sub-lieutenant:</p>

<p>"Connect the forward motor!"</p>

<p>They drew back into the room. "What is that
for?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>Before the captain could reply came the second
order:</p>

<p>"Reverse!"</p>

<p>The motor buzzed, but no effect was produced
on the boat.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>"That seems singular," observed Alfred.</p>

<p>"Not at all," answered the captain.</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"The stern of the submarine is out of the
water," answered the captain.</p>

<p>The power was shut off, and again turned on.
It was now obvious that they were dangling in the
water with the prow of the boat held fast in the
entangling nets. As they glanced out the door
they could see the faces of the seamen moving to
and fro with terror depicted on their countenances.</p>

<p>"They may well fear the results," said the captain.
"But we have a duty to perform, and I
might as well advise you of several things which
we should do and observe. We must try to obtain
the weapons and ammunition. That will be
the first duty. Does either of you know where the
electric switches are?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered both of the boys in one breath.</p>

<p>"I mean the switch in the hold," said the captain.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Alfred. "The one I mean is close
to the dynamo on the switchboard, behind the
steps leading to the conning tower."</p>

<p>"That is correct," answered the captain. "The
control switch for the lighting is in the conning
tower, however, and I call your attention to this,
as it may be of service to us in our work."</p>

<p>"I can see, now, that to keep that in our control
would be the main thing," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"The officer has not yet given any orders to put
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>the boxes in the passageways aside, and he will
not do so, probably, until they are able to ascertain
whether or not the ship will free itself; under the
circumstances, Alfred, I must delegate you to secure
a half-dozen of the revolvers, or remove them
from the box so that we can secrete them later,"
said the captain.</p>

<p>As Ralph crawled from the cabin and moved
toward the main gangway, the captain added: "If
you remember where one of the ammunition boxes
is you might smuggle it into this room, but proceed
very cautiously."</p>

<p>Ralph soon made his way back, carrying with
him one of the revolvers. "There are a dozen in
the box," he said, "and I brought one over to
show you. You see, it is the kind from which the
cylinder can be removed. Wouldn't it be a good
idea to take the cylinders out of all that we can't
use?"</p>

<p>"Capital idea," said the captain. "If you can
find any wire, put it where you can quickly place
your hands on it."</p>

<p>"I found a box of ammunition also," continued
Ralph, "but I haven't tried whether it would fit
the revolvers."</p>

<p>An examination revealed the fact that the cartridges
were not of the same calibre. It was, indeed,
a terrible disappointment.</p>

<p>"Here it is," said Alfred, as he slipped into the
door of the room.</p>

<p>"Ah, this is a different size; you have the right
ones, fortunately," said the captain.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>"Now, let me give you a few words as to the
next,&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A pronounced lurch in the vessel's position interrupted
the captain. The seamen were now
rushing around frantically, and talking excitedly.</p>

<p>"Hold your tongues!" shouted the sub-lieutenant.</p>

<p>The vessel was, evidently, moving. Occasionally,
there would be a heavy, rasping sound, and
the rear end of the boat would seem to settle down
a few feet.</p>

<p>"It's coming all right," said Ralph in excitement.</p>

<p>"Connect forward motor!" again shouted the
sub-lieutenant.</p>

<p>The motor turned smoothly without producing
a disturbing influence on the ship, indicating that
the propeller was still in the air.</p>

<p>"I fear that the sub-lieutenant does not know his
business any too well," remarked the captain.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h2>THE NIGHT'S STRUGGLE TO FREE THE VESSEL</h2>
<br />

<p>The boys wondered at the remark which the captain
had made, and were about to ask him for an
explanation, when the electric lights suddenly died
out, and all were left in total darkness. The captain
crawled past the boys and felt his way toward
the stern of the vessel.</p>

<p>"The storage batteries!" was all he said.</p>

<p>That there was confusion on the part of the
crew of the vessel, was apparent, for the sub-lieutenant
shouted one order after the other, until he
seemed to be incoherent, and, as a result, no one
knew what was expected of him or what to do.</p>

<p>Evidently, the captain knew the trouble and how
to remedy it, for within a minute the lights were
again in commission, and the captain was noticed
at the main switch. From that point he shouted
to the sub-lieutenant:</p>

<p>"I found a box on the switchboard. It had
slipped down and thrown out the switch bar at the
time the boat made the last lurch."</p>

<p>"Thank you for the service," said the sub-lieutenant,
to the surprise of the captain and boys.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>As the captain returned to their room he remarked:
"The sub-lieutenant was very polite;
probably he would not be so likely to thank me for
some other things I have done."</p>

<p>"What! since you left us two minutes ago?"
asked Ralph.</p>

<p>The captain nodded. "But I started to say a
few minutes ago," he continued, "that we ought
to have our work planned out ahead and thoroughly
understand each other. There is one thing
I must impress on you, and that is, we must not
again be locked up in this room. I have no faith in
the present commander, and would be very much
mistaken if he permits us to have our freedom
after we once get free of the nets."</p>

<p>"What must be done if he again orders us
locked up?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"That brings us to the point where we must
make a canvass of the situation as it confronts us.
Let me see; there are three men in addition to the
commander, who need not be reckoned with in a
contest. Fortunately, one of the men is a machinist,
and the only other man except the sub-lieutenant,
of any intelligence, is the doctor. I doubt if
he would be a strong factor against us," said the
captain.</p>

<p>"The fellow who had charge of the men carrying
the boxes is nothing but a chump," said Ralph.
"I wouldn't be afraid of him."</p>

<p>"I am considering more the character of the
men who are able to handle the boat, and who know
the intricacies of the mechanism. I can see where
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>men of that sort will be able to make it very interesting
for us if we should attempt to capture the
officers and crew," said the captain thoughtfully.</p>

<p>It was evident that the vessel was slowly righting
itself, for every minute or two there would be
a slight sinking movement, which was very gratifying.</p>

<p>"Where are the revolvers?" asked the captain.</p>

<p>"I found a dandy place for them, and can get
them in a minute, if wanted," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"Captain, I wanted to ask you some time ago
what you meant by saying that the sub-lieutenant
didn't know any more about submarining than he
ought to. What did you mean by that?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"One of the things I had in mind was, when he
was trying to start the propellers, that he could
have found an easier way to learn whether they
were in the water or not," was the answer.</p>

<p>"How so?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"The indicator board in the conning tower
shows just how far the vessel is under water," replied
the captain.</p>

<p>"But," said Alfred, "would that tell it correctly
if one end of the vessel should be up and the
other down, as this is?"</p>

<p>"Why not? It would indicate how far down in
the water the hull would be amidship, and it
would not require much involved calculating to
figure out where the stern of the vessel would be
if he knew the angle at which the hull was resting,"
answered the captain.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>"I would just like to know how far we are
down," said Ralph, looking up the stairway into
the conning tower.</p>

<p>"Do you think you could spot the right dial
face if you went up?" asked the captain.</p>

<p>"I think I could," said Ralph, rather doubtingly,
it must be admitted.</p>

<p>"Then I'll give you a little hint, if you'd like
to try to make an investigation," said the captain.
"Directly forward of the table, which contains the
chart, and below the three levers, you will see a
glass column with red colored liquid in it,&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know what you mean now," said Ralph, interrupting.</p>

<p>"Well, simply get the number on the card on the
right side of the glass column. Do you understand?"
remarked the captain.</p>

<p>"Yes; but why not take the numbers on the left
side also?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"They merely indicate the pressure. Depth below
the surface is all we want," rejoined the captain.</p>

<p>"Well, here goes; and I hope they won't catch
me at it," said Ralph, as he slowly moved out.</p>

<p>"One moment," said the captain, as he put forth
a restraining hand. "What will you do, or how
will you act if some one should catch you in the
tower?" he asked.</p>

<p>Ralph hesitated: "I hadn't thought of that;
why,&mdash;well,&mdash;I suppose I should try to explain it
in some way or other," he said.</p>

<p>"I am afraid that would not do. Allow me to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>make a suggestion. Go up boldly, as though you
had a perfect right to, or that you did not suspect
it was a forbidden place; if some one accosts you
look at him in a surprised way, make an apology,
and retire; I give you this pointer because you
may be flustrated and unable to make a prompt reply,
and that would show guilt of some kind," said
the captain.</p>

<p>Ralph went out and loitered about, gazing at the
various pieces of machinery, and finally stood on
the steps of the conning tower, which, at the angle
of the boat in its inclined position, were almost
horizontal. He stretched himself out on the stairs,
and turned his head. From that point he could see
the red liquid in the glass column, but it was difficult
to read the figures.</p>

<p>The glare from the electric light interfered with
his sight, and before he had an opportunity to get
a glimpse of the figures from his new position, one
of the petty officers crawled along the passageway,
and, noticing him lying on the stairs, peremptorily
ordered him to get down.</p>

<p>Ralph glanced at the man, smiled at him, and
promptly complied, chagrined at his failure. As
he entered the little room the captain eagerly questioned
him: "What did it say?" he asked.</p>

<p>"That fellow ordered me away before I could
make out the figures," said Ralph, "but I'm going
to try it again."</p>

<p>"How near was the liquid from the top of the
glass tube?" asked the captain.</p>

<p>"Well, I should say about so far," replied
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>Ralph, indicating space between his thumb and finger.
"I guess it was about an inch."</p>

<p>"How long do you think the tube is?" asked the
captain.</p>

<p>"I think it must be a foot long; probably more,"
was the answer.</p>

<p>"I asked you to give me an estimate of the
length of the entire tube so as to give me some assurance
that you knew the value of an inch. You
were right; those tubes are twelve inches long.
Now let me see; I ought to know what figures are
an inch from the top!" remarked the captain
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Captain, but how does it come that
you know all about these boats?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"I used to be an officer on a French submarine,"
he replied in a quiet tone, and immediately proceeded
to make certain mental calculations. Then
he continued: "One inch below the top! That is
twenty."</p>

<p>"Twenty what?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"Twenty feet; the Germans have the English
foot on all their boats. I wonder they didn't think
about that, and make a change before starting
out."</p>

<p>"Maybe it's twenty meters," said Alfred, with
a slight laugh.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," replied the captain. "That would
be too Frenchy for the Germans. Besides, it
would be too much by all odds. I am sure the conning
tower is not more than twenty feet below the
surface of the water."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>"Then the stern of the submarine must be sticking
out of the water," remarked Alfred.</p>

<p>"Unquestionably," replied the captain.</p>

<p>"How far, do you suppose?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"We can easily figure that out," said the captain.
"Let me see; we must first get the angle at
which the boat is lying."</p>

<p>After looking about for some time he continued:
"The door jamb is built in vertically; that is
sure. A string, or piece of thread will make a
plumb-bob; here it is: now let us see; according to
the plumb line the boat is at an angle of 33 degrees,
as nearly as our imperfect device indicates.
There, now this line A shows the top of the boat
and B the base of the conning tower. A line C,
from the top of the water to the center of the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>conning
tower, measuring 20 feet, shows where the
water line is. Do you understand how I am doing
it?"</p>

<p>"That is very plain," said Alfred, "and it is
an interesting way to get at it, too. Then how far
is the tail of the boat out of the water?"</p>

<p>"I should say it is about nine feet," replied the
captain.</p>

<p>"No wonder the propellers didn't do any good
when they sent them spinning!"</p>

<p>"There is one thing I forgot about," said the
captain, as he shook his head. "Why didn't I tell
you to note the time. We are in the greatest danger,
I fear."</p>

<p>"Why, what makes you think so?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"This accident happened during the night, and
we have now been in this condition for at least
four hours. If we are caught here at daylight it
is all up with us," remarked the captain.</p>

<p>"Why, is it any more dangerous then than
now?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"Because the patrol boats and submarine chasers
will spy us, and then a shot, and all will be
over," replied the captain with a solemn voice.</p>

<p>"Then I think we ought to do something right
away," said Ralph, as he half rose and glanced
out.</p>

<p>"I am afraid that will put the burden of getting
out of the nets on our shoulders," replied the captain.
"No, let them work at it, as long as they
care to, but we must try by some means to determine
the time."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>"Do you think the seamen would object to telling
us?" inquired Alfred. "Just let me alone; I
am going to try it on, anyway," he said, as he
slipped out of the door, picked up a box and stowed
it away snugly at one side out of the way of a
young fellow who was making his way up the incline
toward the stern.</p>

<p>Alfred struck up a conversation, and asked:
"Can I help you in any way? Tell me what to
do."</p>

<p>The request seemed to warm up the fellow, and
the information was given that the officer had instructed
him to remove the stray boxes from the
machinery. The two engaged in this work for
more than fifteen minutes. Finally Alfred said:
"How are you, pretty tired? You haven't had
much sleep so far?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no; but we're used to that," he replied,
"why, in the last run we had hardly an hour's
sleep in the last four days before reaching port."</p>

<p>"That must be very trying," rejoined Alfred.
"But it must be near daylight."</p>

<p>"It is just about an hour off; and when the day
comes I don't know what will happen," remarked
the seaman.</p>

<p>"Why, what are you afraid of?" asked Alfred,
appearing to be greatly alarmed.</p>

<p>"They have caught us this time for good, as I
heard the lieutenant,&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The sentence was never finished, for at that moment
there was another rasping sound, and the
stern of the boat came down with a sudden spring,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>then rebounded, and after two or three oscillations,
rested quietly in the water, still at quite an
angle.</p>

<p>The sub-lieutenant sprang toward the conning
tower as fast as he could scramble. The signal
was given to reverse, the motors began to hum and
the ship vibrated. It was a glorious feeling, and
the captain grasped the hands of the boys in an
ecstacy of joy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h2>THE CAPTURE OF THE SUBMERGED VESSEL</h2>
<br />

<p>"Why does it still keep at this angle?" asked
Ralph.</p>

<p>"Have you forgotten the stuff we carried back
into the stern?" replied Alfred.</p>

<p>"Do you think that really is the trouble?" asked
Ralph.</p>

<p>"Yes; it is out of balance, and I suppose we
may look out for another job," said the captain.
"That may be the opportunity we are seeking.
Furthermore, what is to be done must be done just
as soon as possible."</p>

<p>"What makes you think so?" eagerly inquired
Alfred.</p>

<p>"Several things. The first is, that we are now
in the English Channel under the guidance of a
man much less skilful than the lieutenant; and,
secondly, the lieutenant, although badly wounded,
may recover sufficiently to be able to direct affairs,"
replied the captain.</p>

<p>"When I was out there talking with the seaman,"
said Alfred, "I learned that the lieutenant
was in a very low state."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>"I should judge so, too," rejoined the captain,
"for the reason that the doctor has not left the
room once since the lieutenant was taken there.
In making a calculation of the forces against us
I have considered that the lieutenant, the cook and
the doctor are disposed of, so far as being of any
aid to the crew. Three others are also so badly
injured that they do not need to cause us much
worry. I am not certain in my mind, however,
where they are at this time."</p>

<p>"Do you mean the men who were injured?"
asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Two of them are in the bunks behind the compressed
air tanks," answered Ralph.</p>

<p>"Are you quite sure of that?" queried the captain.</p>

<p>"I know it," was the answer.</p>

<p>"Well, that makes six accounted for, so that
there are twenty-one we must meet. Now I shall
give a few general instructions before we proceed.
The sub-lieutenant has gone into the conning
tower. As he entered I tried to get a glimpse to
ascertain whether or not the sun had risen, but
was unable to decide, but I should judge that it
is not yet daylight or he would not be running on
the surface. As a precautionary measure we must
have the weapons ready, and have the revolvers
put away so as not to expose them before we are
ready."</p>

<p>"Here they are," said Ralph, who cautiously
brought them to the room.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>"Shall we load them?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"By all means; and let me warn you of one
thing: when you aim be sure to hit. There must
be no pretense about it. The matter is too serious
for anything but strict business. I hope we shall
not have the opportunity or necessity for using
the revolvers. Now pay attention to the details:
the sub-lieutenant must be the first one captured,
and he must be taken into the conning tower. I
suggest that you, Ralph, take your place beneath
the stairway, hiding, as much as possible, behind
the amidship tank, while you, Alfred, remain at
the door of our room here."</p>

<p>"Shall I stay here so I can be seen or keep out
of sight?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"Remain under cover inside the room, but in
sight of the stairway. You have probably noticed
that the under officer makes frequent trips to the
conning tower, and that on returning each time he
turns a short lever below the hinge," said the captain.</p>

<p>"I have noticed that several times and wondered
what it was for," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"That is for the purpose of holding the hatch
door so that it can be opened by him when he
again ascends the stairway. Now, when the under
officer opens the hatch and comes down the hatch
stairs, will be the time for you to come out of the
room and take up your position at the forward
corner of the room; that will completely hide you
from the eyes of the officer. I shall then go into
the room, the moment he reaches the last step, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>thus he will not suspect me. The moment he
reaches the passageway opposite the door, I will
hold him up with my revolver, and compel him to
enter the room. The moment that is done you will
push the door shut, as you will see that it has a
spring lock. Do you fully understand the instructions
so far?" asked the captain.</p>

<p>"I think so," answered Alfred, "although I
don't exactly understand why I am to go into the
room first, and then come out the moment the hatch
is being opened."</p>

<p>"For the reason that we must not be suspected
by the others, some of whom are at all times not
far away, and if, while we are waiting, some of the
crew should pass the end of our room they would
be sure to see you and consider that a peculiar
place for you to be in. Do you understand it
now?" replied the captain.</p>

<p>"Then, after that what will take place?" asked
Ralph, his breath coming thick and fast.</p>

<p>"I shall go up the stairway, followed by Alfred.
While this is going on it will be your duty, Ralph,
to watch the workers at the dynamo and the aft
tank. They are the only ones who will be able to
see the stairway clearly. If you see any look of
alarm on their faces, or see that they notice what is
going on, move around into the opening, and level
both revolvers at them, without, however, making
any sound. Hold them in that position until I
raise the trap-door and warn the sub-lieutenant.
Alfred will follow close and hold the trap-door
from being sprung. Then move up the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>companionway
as fast as you can. There, he is going up now.
Take your place, Ralph."</p>

<p>The crucial time had come. Alfred retreated
into the little room as the captain leisurely moved
along the narrow passageway toward the dynamos.
Thus they waited and waited, five, ten minutes.
Ages seemed to pass. Then the hatch door
opened slowly. Alfred came out quietly without
looking around, moved forward, and then walked
back and slid into the corner of the room.</p>

<p>The petty officer closed the hatch and moved
down the steps, brushing past the captain. As he
did so the captain entered the door and immediately
turned with the revolver pointing at the officer's
breast.</p>

<p>"Not a sound, or I fire," said the captain in a
voice which could not be heard a dozen feet away.
The captain stepped aside, and pointed to the open
doorway, at the same time indicating by motions
that the German should enter it. The officer gritted
his teeth and finally obeyed. As the captain
stood there with the revolver at his side, but
pointed at the man, Alfred slowly closed the door.</p>

<p>The captain now turned and moved up the stairway.
With his revolver drawn he pushed open the
trap-door quietly, and, in a quiet voice, said:
"Hands up!"</p>

<p>The sub-lieutenant turned quickly, to look into
the muzzle of the revolver. His hands reached out
to seize a lever.</p>

<p>"<i>Stop!</i>" said the captain, and the officer quickly
raised his hands.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>Alfred was now in the tower, and Ralph, walking
up backwards, had his head through the hatch
opening, when a shot was fired. He dropped one
of his revolvers, and Alfred quickly seized him by
the shoulders and drew him up. The hatch cover
came down with a bang.</p>

<p>"Are you hurt?" asked Alfred, as Ralph
dropped down, but he was reassured as the latter
arose. For the moment the captain's gaze was
averted, when, quick as thought, the officer's hand
touched a lever.</p>

<p>The captain smiled, as he said: "I am afraid the
valve of the submerging tank will not work; I
prefer running on the surface. But, in the meantime,
as I am commander of this vessel, and I notice
that you are trying to interfere, I shall have
to restrict your movements somewhat."</p>

<p>Saying this he drew a small cord from his pocket
and instructed Alfred to bind the arms at the
wrists. The hands of the officer were then carried
around to the back and the cord fastened to a
stanchion at one side, where he was out of reach
of the instrument board.</p>

<p>This gave the captain an opportunity to examine
Ralph's wound. The latter had quickly rallied.
It was the shot, coupled with the extreme tension,
which caused him momentarily to collapse, for it
was found that the wound had passed through the
fleshy part of the arm above the elbow.</p>

<p>"I suppose you want the destroyers to sink us,"
said the officer.</p>

<p>"Not at all," replied the captain. "Unscrew
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>the bolts of the door, Alfred. And now a word
more, Mr. Officer. Where are your flags?"</p>

<p>"I refuse to inform you," said the officer, with
a look of determination in his face.</p>

<p>"I expect a shot every minute," said the captain,
"for I know as well as you do that there is a
cruiser on our port side. I shall give you another
opportunity; where are the flags?"</p>

<p>"You must open the hatch for them," said the
officer.</p>

<p>"All the bolts are out," said Alfred, turning
to the captain.</p>

<p>"Guard the officer while I go out and signal,"
said the captain.</p>

<p>Before the captain reached the door there was
an ominous boom in the distance. Alfred could see
the officer's face grow pale. A shower of sea
water sprayed over the deck, and some of the
water entered the open door. Looking out he saw
the captain, who had thrown off his coat and vest,
and was now drawing off his white shirt, which
he held up and waved to and fro, just as the second
shot boomed.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the shot was too far away to be at
all dangerous, as Alfred thought, but the voice of
the captain explained it.</p>

<p>"Signal to stop!"</p>

<p>"Which lever?" inquired Alfred.</p>

<p>The latter hesitated. He glanced out the door
and then at the boy. To refuse meant that the ship
was doomed and his companions below without
hope of rescue.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>The captain, with the white signal in his hand,
stepped to the door, and with the revolver pointing
full into the face of the officer, said: "Stop the
ship or you will never have an opportunity to save
yourselves or your companions."</p>

<p>"Pull the second lever," he said, and Alfred did
as directed.</p>

<p>"Reverse!" demanded the captain.</p>

<p>"The lever below," said the officer.</p>

<p>A mile away was a small, speedy craft, sailing
around the submarine. It seemed fairly to skim
over the surface of the water, and cast the spray
astern like a mist. It had come up unnoticed by
the captain.</p>

<p>"Look at the little boat," shouted Ralph, who
had now recovered and had moved to the open
door.</p>

<p>The captain turned quickly toward the stern,
waving the white flag in a frenzy. It must have
been regarded as a remarkable thing to those on
board the little cutter to see a German submarine
hoisting a surrender flag. It seemed too good to
be true. They evidently supposed the white flag
was a ruse of some kind, for they did not venture
nearer.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the cruiser, which had fired the two
shots, came up behind the little craft, and the latter
cautiously steamed up. The small vessel was
one of the speedy torpedo boat chasers, carrying
two three-inch guns, and drawing less than six
feet of water. The safety of these boats lies in
their great speed and in the shallow draft, which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>prevents the submarine from reaching them with
their torpedoes.</p>

<p>Once abreast the commander called out: "I am
sending a boat for your officers."</p>

<p>"I have only one here, that we can get at, at
present," shouted the captain.</p>

<p>"What is that?" asked the commander of the
chaser.</p>

<p>"I have one of the chief officers in the conning
tower, and the others are below," said the captain.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" asked the commander.</p>

<p>"Captain Leclere, of the French service," replied
the captain.</p>

<p>"Captain Leclere!" almost shouted the German
officer in the conning tower.</p>

<p>"That's the man," said Alfred.</p>

<p>"Then I am not surprised," said the officer in a
low voice.</p>

<p>"Surprised?" said Ralph. "Did you say 'surprised?'"</p>

<p>The officer sighed, turned his head away, and
was silent.</p>

<p>A lieutenant and four seamen reached the side
of the submarine, and were drawn aboard.</p>

<p>"Ah! it was your ship that went down in the
bay last Wednesday," said the chaser's lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Yes; we were picked up by the submarine, together
with my two young friends here," said the
captain.</p>

<p>"And how does it happen that you are in command
of this vessel?" he asked in surprise.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>"We captured it about a half an hour ago, and
have the chief officer and the crew below," replied
the captain.</p>

<p>"That is certainly a remarkable exploit," replied
the lieutenant. "I suppose you will be glad
to meet the commander of <i>l'Orient</i>?" said the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Ah! Captain Tournai, you mean! I recognized
the French colors. But I supposed he was
in the Mediterranean; it will be quite a pleasure,
indeed. Do me the honor to signal him," said the
captain.</p>

<p>The lieutenant gave the necessary instructions,
and the flags wig-wagged from the bridge of the
little vessel.</p>

<p>The sub-lieutenant was called out of the conning
tower, and Alfred directed to unloosen the cords.</p>

<p>"I suppose you will take charge of the prisoners,"
said the captain.</p>

<p>"I should be glad to do so, with your permission,
although you have a right, of course, to turn
them over to <i>l'Orient</i>," said the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"No; it is sufficient gratification to know that
we have the vessel," said the captain, "and I shall
be glad to leave to you the disposition of the men
and the vessel."</p>

<p>"What procedure would you suggest?" asked
the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"I shall give an order to the sub-lieutenant directing
the men to come out of the hold," said the
captain. Then, turning to the sub-lieutenant, he
said:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>"You will inform the men below that they are
to present themselves at the hatch."</p>

<p>The officer bowed, and entered the conning tower
He immediately descended. Before he had,
reached the bottom the captain said:</p>

<p>"Halt! Notify them from where you are. I
shall not permit you to go any farther."</p>

<p>All the men were found to be stationed near the
hatchway steps. One by one they appeared, and
were escorted out, a dozen marines in the meantime
having appeared in two boats. As they
emerged from the door they were escorted to the
side and directed to take their places in the ship's
boats.</p>

<p>"That makes twenty-one," said Alfred.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h2>THE SECRET KEY TO THE BOMB FUSE</h2>
<br />

<p>"Shall I go down and assist in bringing up the
lieutenant?" said the sub-lieutenant, as the doctor
of the submarine passed out.</p>

<p>"No; I have decided that he shall not be removed
until this evening," said the captain. "In
the meantime the doctor may return, and give him
such aid as is necessary."</p>

<p>The sub-lieutenant's face turned pale, and he
trembled. This was the first show of weakness
that he exhibited. The boys looked at the captain,
and turned their glances toward the officer of the
chaser. They could not understand it. The captain
continued:</p>

<p>"I believe the chief machinist is also injured, as
well as two of the machine tenders. They may
also remain until after the lieutenant is brought
up."</p>

<p>All present noticed the wrought-up condition of
the sub-lieutenant, and the latter soon exhibited
evidence that he was breaking down. At last he
remarked with trembling voice:</p>

<p>"At what time can they be brought up?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell at this time; possibly not until
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>tomorrow," said the captain, directing a searching
glance at the officer.</p>

<p>"He is very ill," said the doctor.</p>

<p>"I have no doubt of it," replied the captain.
"The length of their stay in the submarine will depend
on the length of the fuse attached to the time
explosive in the hold."</p>

<p>The sub-lieutenant almost dropped as the captain
uttered these words, and the boys exchanged
significant glances, while the lieutenant of the
chaser smiled.</p>

<p>"You did not think," continued the captain,
"that I would be so lax in my duty as to permit
you to plant a mine under our feet?"</p>

<p>The sub-lieutenant dropped his eyes without answering.
The captain gazed at him intently, as he
continued: "For the present you will be detained,
and the time of the removal of the lieutenant with
his companions will be decided within the next two
hours."</p>

<p>With this decision the sub-lieutenant was put in
charge of the marines, while he descended to enter
the boat. As he was about to step aboard, he
turned to the captain and said: "It will be too late
if you defer the decision for two hours."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the captain with a faint smile, "you
have thought better of it. Will the fuse last an
hour?"</p>

<p>The sub-lieutenant nodded. The captain waved
his arms and directed the officer to proceed. The
latter unceremoniously pushed the sub-lieutenant
into the boat.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>"I will see to it that the fuses are taken out,"
said the sub-lieutenant, recovering from his sullen
attitude.</p>

<p>The captain paid no attention to the remarks
of the officer. As soon as the sub-lieutenant was
well out of hearing, the captain turned to the boys
and said: "It may be a difficult and trying duty to
you to perform, but it is the only safe thing to do.
As you know almost every part of the submarine
from the investigation you have made, I would
ask you to follow me, and I will tell you what to
do."</p>

<p>The boys nodded their heads, and entered the
conning tower with the captain. The latter turned,
before descending, and said:</p>

<p>"You will have observed, no doubt, that the
scheme was to turn over the submarine to us as
soon as possible, leaving a time fuse, which, within
a specified time, would have blown the ship to
atoms. By so doing they would accomplish two
purposes, namely, destroy the ship, and save their
own lives. We must not put confidence in any
statement they may make."</p>

<p>"But wouldn't it be a good idea to let the sub-lieutenant
remove the fuses, as he said he would
do?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"Would you be willing to rely on that?"</p>

<p>"Well, I wouldn't," replied Alfred. "I could
tell by the way the sub-lieutenant acted that he
would play a trick if he could."</p>

<p>"That is just why I want you to assist me in
check-mating," said the captain.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>"Tell us just what to do, and you may depend
on us," replied Ralph.</p>

<p>"As you know many of the dark places below
I want you to go down with me and find several
where you can secrete yourselves. I will then send
the sub-lieutenant down, and order him to remove
the fuses. I want you to be particular to observe
every step he takes, and, as far as possible, note
what he does at each place; do you understand?"
said the captain.</p>

<p>"Perfectly," replied Ralph.</p>

<p>Together they descended. All were well aware
that the lieutenant, the doctor, and the three
wounded men were still in the dining galley, the
door of which had been closed and locked by orders
of the captain, after the last of the submarine
crew reached the upper deck.</p>

<p>"I know one good place where a fellow can hide
and still see what is going on," said Alfred.</p>

<p>"Where is that?" asked the captain.</p>

<p>"At that tank by the side of the dining galley,"
replied Alfred.</p>

<p>"That would be a good vantage point," answered
the captain. "It is the aft trimming tank,
and if you can find a place of concealment it would,
at the same time, enable you to overhear any conversation
that might possibly take place, when the
sub-lieutenant is performing his unwelcome duty."</p>

<p>"Then maybe I ought to get somewhere forward
of the main hatch?" proposed Ralph.</p>

<p>"I suppose you have your revolvers with you?"
said the captain.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>"I know mine is all right," replied Ralph.</p>

<p>"So is mine, I think," said Alfred, "although I
haven't had an opportunity to try it so far."</p>

<p>"I hope there will be no necessity for anything
of that kind," said the captain. "However, we
are dealing with men who are desperate, and who
have been taught that they must do desperate
things to accomplish their purposes, hence the safe
rule, in all cases, in dealing with them, is to do the
very opposite of that which they wish you to do."</p>

<p>"Is that the reason why you refused to let him
remove the fuse?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>The captain laughed quietly, as he replied: "He
thinks I have refused to let him do so, but he will
be surprised to get the order to remove the fuses,
and be permitted to go down into the vessel unaccompanied."</p>

<p>"Then he is to come down here without you?"
said Ralph in surprise.</p>

<p>"Why, certainly; and that is why I want some
one here to watch proceedings," said the captain.</p>

<p>"Oh! I understand now," replied Alfred.
"That's a good idea. If anything happens we'll
find out what it is if any one can."</p>

<p>"I believe it," answered the captain. "And
now select your places. I will go up and send him
down within the next fifteen minutes."</p>

<p>Alfred took up his station at one side of the aft
trimming tank, and Ralph, after some investigation,
upturned one of the boxes which was still
lying in the passageway directly to one side of the
steps leading to the conning tower, and after a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>little search, found two more, which were drawn
together, thus forming a retreat which enabled
him to observe the movements of any one on three
sides.</p>

<p>All this was done in silence, and all preparation
having been made, the captain ascended. After
reaching the deck-house of the chaser, he requested
the sub-lieutenant's presence. As he approached,
between the two guards, the captain said: "I have
concluded that you may go down and remove the
fuses, and I shall depend on your honor to do it
effectually."</p>

<p>The sub-lieutenant bowed stiffly, and was led to
the boat, followed by the captain. As they reached
the conning tower, the captain continued: "I will
remain here. I shall give you ten minutes' time
to do the work."</p>

<p>The sub-lieutenant descended, and was somewhat
surprised to find himself alone in the interior.
The electric lights were burning brightly.
Ralph was the first to view his movements. The
officer first moved to a point directly opposite, and
with a key opened a door, which Ralph had never
theretofore noticed. In a moment the door was
again closed and Ralph saw a short section of a
fuse, which the officer quickly pushed into a dark
recess below.</p>

<p>From that point he moved toward the stern,
stopping at the motors; then he quickly turned
around and glanced about in a suspicious manner.
As he stooped down, Ralph made a slight noise on
one of the boxes, and the officer straightened up
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>like a shot. The movement indicated a guilty act,
and Ralph divined that the purpose was to injure
the motors.</p>

<p>The sub-lieutenant moved cautiously to the rear,
and in a few moments was abreast of the dining
galley. Here he was within hearing of Alfred behind
the aft trimming tanks. He saw the officer
go to the door, and give three quick knocks.
"Herr Schwoger!" he said in a subdued voice.
In another moment a voice within replied: "The
fuses; you must not forget them."</p>

<p>To this the sub-lieutenant answered: "I have
been ordered to remove them; what shall I do?"</p>

<p>"Take out all but the forward fuse, and report,"
said the voice. "Tell us what has happened,"
continued the voice, which was now recognized
as the doctor's.</p>

<p>"They have complete command, and two warships
are outside," was the reply.</p>

<p>From this point the officer crossed over to the
starboard side of the vessel and at a large stand-pipe
stooped down. Alfred tried to ascertain what
he was doing, but was unable to detect the nature
of his work. The sub-lieutenant then crossed back
to the other side, and, working his way quickly
to the motors, stooped down. Ralph could no
longer restrain himself. He quickly and quietly
moved toward the officer, as he saw him with a
long tool of some kind in his hand reach down to
the base of the motor.</p>

<p>"Hands up!" shouted Ralph.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>The tool dropped from the hands of the officer
with a click.</p>

<p>Alfred was at the side of the sub-lieutenant in
an instant. "You may go on deck," said Ralph.</p>

<p>The officer glanced at Alfred, whom he had seen
emerge from the aft hiding place, and then turned
a look of contempt on Ralph.</p>

<p>"Move!" said Ralph, pointing to the gangway.</p>

<p>Alfred cocked his revolver and menacingly
pointed it at him.</p>

<p>There was only one thing to do and he did it.
He was met by the captain at the head of the stairway.</p>

<p>The boys followed quickly. The captain looked
on at the leveled revolvers and appeared to be surprised.</p>

<p>"What does all this mean?" he asked.</p>

<p>"It means that he tried to destroy the motors,
and we caught him at it in time," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"That is not so," replied the officer.</p>

<p>"What is this for?" asked Alfred, as he held
up the tool which the officer had dropped.</p>

<p>"But you have removed all the fuses, of
course?" said the captain, apparently not heeding
the tool referred to.</p>

<p>"I have," said the officer, straightening up.</p>

<p>"All but the one at the forward part of the vessel,"
replied Alfred.</p>

<p>The officer turned, with a look of surprise and
chagrin on his face. "He does not know what he
is talking about," said the officer.</p>

<p>"Then you are lying to me as you are to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>captain," said Alfred. "You told the doctor in the
galley that you had removed all but the forward
one. Did you lie to him?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>A blush seemed to suffuse the officer's face, as
the captain said:</p>

<p>"We will go down together. There may be some
more work to do; come on," said the captain, as he
indicated the way. "You may go first, Ralph, the
sub-lieutenant will follow."</p>

<p>There was no help for it. Once below the captain
said: "You will save yourself considerable
trouble by removing the fuse from the forward
bomb, and that without further waste of words."</p>

<p>The officer knew that the manner in which the
words were uttered meant business. Without
waiting for the second warning, he led the way,
opened another secret door, and removed the tell-tale
fuse.</p>

<p>"Ah, ha! cut for two hours! Now, while we
are about it you might as well start the motor; we
have some use for it," said the captain.</p>

<p>"I cannot do that," replied the officer.</p>

<p>"So you succeeded in injuring it," said the
captain.</p>

<p>"No," was the reply.</p>

<p>The captain picked up the tool, which Alfred
was so particular to carry along. "And what was
this used for?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes; I have disarranged the motor fields so
that they are useless; and I don't deny it," said
the officer, straightening up and looking at the captain
defiantly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>"There; that is something like it; but you
haven't deceived me in the least. I have brought
a very useful article with me," continued the captain,
drawing from his pocket a paper and presenting
it to the officer. "It contains instructions,
which I expect you to follow, for your own safety.
I shall see to it that the fuses you removed are
again put into place and the mechanism set for
one hour. Of course, I shall hold the keys. Under
those conditions you may remain locked below,
and I shall expect you to obey my signals, as we
intend to navigate the vessel to port, which will,
as you know, occupy about fifty minutes of time.
Do you know where the fuse boxes are?" said the
captain, turning to the boys.</p>

<p>Ralph marched to the side wall and pointed to
the place where the sub-lieutenant opened the first
box.</p>

<p>"Open it!" ordered the captain, turning to the
sub-lieutenant.</p>

<p>The latter hesitated. The captain stared at him
sternly and repeated the order. As he made no
motion, the captain continued: "Why do you hesitate?"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h2>OPERATING THE SUBMARINE WITH A CAPTIVE CREW</h2>
<br />

<p>The officer now saw that he was dealing with a
man who understood the motives of those aboard
the submarine, and it was also evident that the
sympathy of the boys was turned from the young
man. The latter had played his part to the ultimate.</p>

<p>"You have now done all and more than is required
of you," said the captain, as he altered his
tone of voice. "You have set the automatic device,
which, in due time, would have sent this vessel
to the bottom. I understand all these devices,
and they will not avail you. I understand, as well
as you do, that to open that box will cause an explosion;
but it is necessary to make an example
of you." Then, turning to the boys, he said: "You
may go on deck. As for you, Mr. Officer, I shall
detain you below a sufficient length of time to be
sure that the automatic device gets in its work.
We really have no use for the submarine."</p>

<p>He turned and started up the stairway, when
the sub-lieutenant, with trembling voice, said: "I
am powerless to prevent the explosion,&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Unless," interrupted the captain.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>The officer nodded his head. "I supposed so!"
continued the captain. "The lieutenant in the galley
has the key which controls the automatic device.
You may open the door and get the key, and
from this time forward, if I find that you deceive
me in the slightest degree, or make any attempt to
injure the vessel, I will make it your grave without
a moment's hesitation, and without the least compunction."</p>

<p>The sub-lieutenant moved toward the galley, and
opened the door. In a moment he reappeared
with the key and followed the captain to the conning
tower.</p>

<p>Below the switchboard was a tiny slot. Into this
the key neatly fitted, and upon giving a turn, a set
of switches was exposed.</p>

<p>"These are the control circuits," he said.</p>

<p>"Turn them off and open the boxes below!" ordered
the captain. This was done.</p>

<p>"Who are the men that operate the trimming
tanks?" asked the captain.</p>

<p>"The machinist Scholer and his assistant
Bracher," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant," said the captain, addressing the
commander of the chaser; "send those men on
board."</p>

<p>When they appeared the captain continued:
"You will go below with these men, and obey my
signals, as we take the vessel to port, and remember,
that if any part of the machinery is destroyed
I will not guarantee to deliver you safely on
shore."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>As they disappeared, the trap-door was closed,
and the boys were free, for the first time since the
eventful morning, five days previous to this time,
when they stepped aboard the submarine.</p>

<p>They now realized, in a particularly pointed
manner, that while the air in a submarine seems
to be fairly pure, it is filled with the most noxious
fumes, due to the petroleum and lubricants, as
well as to the odors due to cooking, all of which
cannot be gotten rid of, however constantly the
air-circulating apparatus of the ship is in operation.</p>

<p>The greatest efforts have been made to automatically
discharge these odors, but the hundreds of
dead corners within a hull of this character make
it impossible to effect a thorough discharge, and
when the trap-door finally closes down there is a
peculiar feeling, not unlike seasickness, which
seemed to attack one.</p>

<p>"I understand your feelings," said the captain,
as he noticed the pale faces of the boys. "It is
wonderful how you have been able to keep up, and
not exhibit symptoms before this. I will have two
seamen come over to assist me in the conning
tower."</p>

<p>"I wish you wouldn't do that," said Alfred, as
he placed his hand on his temples. "I am sure we
will get over this in time."</p>

<p>"No, no; we want to stay with you, if you don't
mind," insisted Ralph. "I am all right now," and
he tried to smile, but it was not a very successful
effort.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>"Then I suppose I shall have to accede; yes,
lieutenant, we can take care of the boat, but I shall
expect you to act as our convoy," replied the captain.</p>

<p>The lieutenant directed his men to pull for the
chaser, and the captain turned to the operating
board. "Forward," the word was plain. The signal
was made by two distinct rings. The propellers
turned. The captain, with his hands on the
wheel, turned to starboard and made a short turn.
This brought the vessel alongside the chaser. A
slight turn to port, then forward, and they glided
alongside <i>l'Orient</i>.</p>

<p>The crew had been lined up on the port side,
and the captain at the end of the bridge raised his
cap in salute as they passed by.</p>

<p>"Where are we going?" asked Ralph, as he saw
the prow pointing to the south. "Are we going
to France?"</p>

<p>"What are those funny things bobbing up there
for,&mdash;that whole line?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"They are the floats for the torpedo nets," replied
the captain. "We are now on our way to go
through the gates, and thus avoid the nets."</p>

<p>"Is that why we are following the torpedo
chaser?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"Yes, and when once inside the lane, we will
change our course and reach the English base for
craft of this kind," said the captain.</p>

<p>The submarine followed the wake of the chaser
for fully a half hour, when, for some reason, that
boat stopped. As they neared it they noticed the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>sailors and marines aboard on the port side, and
intently engaged in looking forward.</p>

<p>"What's up now, I wonder?" said Alfred, as he
opened the door of the conning tower and stepped
on the deck.</p>

<p>"Look at the floats ahead," said the captain.</p>

<p>On investigation two of them were noticed moving
back and forth, and occasionally dipping in an
unaccountable manner.</p>

<p>"Look at those fellows with the guns on the deck
of the chaser," said Ralph.</p>

<p>Alfred looked up. He saw the gun crews at
their stations, with the officers in charge of the
guns standing at one side in attitudes of expectancy.</p>

<p>"I know," said Alfred. "They have caught one
of them."</p>

<p>"Yes; and they are making the same efforts to
get away that we were engaged in only a few
hours ago," said the captain.</p>

<p>The chaser steamed back and forth in a quiet,
determined way, the men never for a moment relaxing
their watch.</p>

<p>"What are they trying to do with that funny-looking,
big, fat gun on the side near the front end
of the deck?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"That is a howitzer," answered the captain.</p>

<p>"What in the world do they want a howitzer
for?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"To use it on the boat if it should get free from
the net," replied the captain.</p>

<p>"Why don't they use it now?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>"Because they do not want to destroy the boat
unless it is absolutely necessary," answered the
captain.</p>

<p>"But how will they know whether the boat gets
away?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"By the condition of the floats," answered the
captain. "You will notice that the two floats
within range of the submarine's action are being
dragged down. If the floats should be in a normal
condition, or float on their true water line, which
you can readily observe by glasses, it is evident
that the submarine is free."</p>

<p>"And then that would be the time they would
use the howitzers?" suggested Alfred.</p>

<p>"But how could they reach the submarine?"
asked Ralph. "Do they know just where the vessel
is now?"</p>

<p>"Yes, they can locate it within a hundred feet;
but that would be near enough for their purpose,"
replied the captain.</p>

<p>"Do you mean," asked Alfred, "that they
would send the shell from the howitzer anywhere
near them, and that it would destroy the submarine
even though it didn't hit it?"</p>

<p>"Yes; the detonating or rupturing effect of the
high explosive in the shells is such that even
though the explosion would take place a hundred
feet from the hull, it would put it out of commission
at once, and, in all probability, crush in the
sides like an egg shell," said the captain.</p>

<p>"Why are they signaling?" asked Ralph, as the
wig-wagging began.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>"I think that's <i>l'Orient</i> in sight on the port
side," replied the captain, after gazing in the direction
indicated.</p>

<p>"Then the cruiser will take the position of the
chaser?" said Alfred.</p>

<p>"Quite likely," answered the captain.</p>

<p>"Look at the smoke; she's coming this way,"
shouted Ralph.</p>

<p>The captain waved his hand to the lieutenant
on the chaser, as he shouted: "They have responded
to your signals."</p>

<p>As <i>l'Orient</i> approached and took up position,
the chaser, with a parting salute, turned and
started for its former course along the line of
buoys. The boys looked back and kept their eyes
on the moving buoys as far as they could see them.</p>

<p>"It will never get away," said the captain.</p>

<p>The chaser described a long curve, and changed
its course due east, and, following it, they were at
the entrance which had been left free. Beyond
were several other small vessels, two of which
dashed up and steamed alongside. The crews
cheered as the boys emerged from the conning
tower and waved their caps.</p>

<p>The lieutenant quickly informed the officers
aboard the other boats of the prize, which had been
taken by those aboard of her, and the news redoubled
their noisy welcome. The tell-tale number
on the side of the conning tower, U-96, was
sufficient to inform the crews of the passing vessels
that another of the dreaded boats was out of
action.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>Once within the lane, as the path between the
two lines of buoyed nets is called, they turned and
steamed north. Vessels were passing and repassing;
transport and hospital ships; immense freight
carriers, and saucy little tugs drawing barge-like
flat-boats; innumerable fast launches and large
war vessels, going to and fro between the shores
of England and France.</p>

<p>Within a half-hour they again approached the
place where <i>l'Orient</i> was watching the struggles
of the entangled submarine. The boys thought of
the trying hours when they, too, were thus imperilled,
and could hardly refrain from shuddering
at the thought of the human beings in the narrow
prison house below the waves.</p>

<p>Evidently, something exciting was taking place,
for the cruiser was constantly manoeuvering, and
the men at the howitzers were keenly alive. Occasionally,
there would be a lull in the movement
of the buoys and it was during those moments that
the most intense activity was shown on board the
guarding vessel.</p>

<p>"I don't understand how it is that the submarine
can get fastened to the nets," said Ralph to
the captain, as they leaned over the rail of their
vessel.</p>

<p>"The meshes of the nets are very large,&mdash;that is,
of sufficient diameters to permit the ends of the
submarines to pass into them," replied the captain.</p>

<p>"But, if that is the case why cannot the submarines
back out in the same way that they went in?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>"They can, if the mesh is too small to take
more than the bow of the vessel; but, in the event
the mesh is large enough to permit the bow to enter,
and the net once gets behind the fins of the
submarine, that is the end of them, for the vessel
cannot, in that case, free itself," responded the
captain.</p>

<p>"How was it in our case?" asked Ralph. "Do
you think the fins of our ship got caught?"</p>

<p>"I did not explain it to you at the time, as I did
not wish to alarm you; but this vessel had one of
its fins through the net. Evidently we struck the
nets at an angle, and the tide helped us in keeping
the hull against the net at the proper angle. The
lieutenant knew this, for he adopted the only
method known to free the ship under those circumstances,"
said the captain.</p>

<p>"So you think the lieutenant knew that only one
fin had caught, and for that reason he tried to up-end
the ship?" inquired Alfred.</p>

<p>"Yes; but not that alone. I observed one thing
that you may have overlooked," remarked the
Captain. "He was particular to store all the
boxes which we helped to carry aft, on the starboard
side."</p>

<p>"I noticed that," said Ralph hurriedly, "and
that wasn't all. Every time a box was brought in
he would ask: 'Heavy or light,' and I have many
times wondered why he did so."</p>

<p>"I did notice one thing, though," said Alfred,
"and that was, when the rear end of the submarine
shot upward, and the boxes came tumbling
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>down, that the hull seemed to roll around to the
left."</p>

<p>"That was our salvation," replied the captain.
"I then knew we had a chance."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h2>THE DEATH BLOW TO THE SUBMARINE</h2>
<br />

<p>Let us try to get some idea of the situation.
Ahead of the boat on which the boys were watching
the scene, and probably not more than eight hundred
feet distant, was <i>l'Orient</i>. Between them was
the row of buoys, as far as the eye could see,
stretching from the shore of England to the coast
of France. To their right, and not two hundred
feet distant was the saucy little chaser, which acted
as their convoy.</p>

<p>At a point which might be termed midway between
the three vessels thus described, were the
two buoys, which moved with spasmodic jerks,
due to the action of the imprisoned vessel below.
As they looked along the bobbing buoys in either
direction, small vessels were observed, patrolling
to and fro, in the tiny mast, or lookout of each, being
two or more men, with glasses, constantly
scrutinizing the floats as the ships slowly moved
past.</p>

<p>Apparently, at regular intervals, were large
ships of war, all of them in motion. Sailing vessels
and steamers, carrying freight, were coming
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>up the channel, convoyed to the open doors in this
giant network which guarded the channel.</p>

<p>The lieutenant on the chaser backed his vessel
toward the submarine and hailed the captain:</p>

<p>"Do you wish to remain?" he asked.</p>

<p>"The chances of that fellow seem to be pretty
slim. I would like to see the finish of the game;
but I suppose we ought to get into port as soon as
possible," answered the captain.</p>

<p>"Then I will give the order to proceed," replied
the lieutenant.</p>

<p>The captain nodded, and the boys started for the
door.</p>

<p>"One moment!" said the captain. "We may
still be able to see an interesting sight."</p>

<p>The boys rushed out of the door. Glancing up
at the deck of the chaser they could see the marines
aboard rushing to the side of the vessel. As
they looked at the buoys it was noticed that they
were silent. <i>L'Orient</i> was slowly backing away
from the obvious location of the submerged vessel.</p>

<p>"They are about to throw a shell," observed the
captain.</p>

<p>The remark had hardly left his mouth when an
explosion was heard and the shell could be observed
moving upward at a very high angle, and
descending into the water with a vicious plunge.</p>

<p>No sooner had it struck the sea than it seemed
to raise the surface of the water like the foaming
mass in a boiling pot. The explosion was dull, vibrant,
ominous.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>"They are shooting another one," shouted Alfred,
although he tried to suppress his voice.</p>

<p>"Boom!" came the sound, as he uttered the
words.</p>

<p>The second shot struck the water not fifty feet
distant from the first one.</p>

<p>"Do you think they will fire another?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"Probably not," answered the captain.</p>

<p>"What is that little boat going over there for?"
asked Ralph, as one of the torpedo boats boldly
advanced over the spot where the two shells had
entered the water.</p>

<p>The captain nodded his head for a few moments
before speaking.</p>

<p>"The shots were successful."</p>

<p>"I can see that now," said Ralph. "Look at the
oil coming up and covering the sea."</p>

<p>It was, indeed, a sad sight to witness, knowing
that the shots meant the death of thirty or more
human beings.</p>

<p>"Well, I am awfully sorry for them, even if they
had no sympathy for us, and didn't wait to see
whether or not we were put into safety before they
sent our ship down," said Alfred reflectively, as
he turned and entered the conning tower.</p>

<p>The scene had its fascination for Ralph, although
he felt the horror of it all as he stood leaning
over the railing, gazing at the patrol boats
which were sailing back and forth in and around
the spot where the petroleum was fast covering
the surface of the water in all directions.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>"You can understand now, can't you, why flying
machines are such good spotters for submarines?"
remarked the captain.</p>

<p>"Do you mean the oil that comes on top of the
water?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"Yes," was the reply.</p>

<p>"But does oil arise at all times when a submarine
is submerged?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"More or less oil is constantly detaching itself
from the body of the hull, at the discharge ports,
and it can't be helped because all of the gas discharge
ports are under water at all times, whether
the vessel is running on or under the water, hence,
as it moves along it will leave a trail of oil which
can be easily detected by a machine in flight above
the surface of the water," said the captain.</p>

<p>"But doesn't a machine, when it is under the
water, leave a ripple that is easily seen by a flying
machine?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"Yes; I was going to refer to that," replied the
captain. "An aviator has a great advantage over
an observer on a vessel, for the reason that the
slightest movement of the surface of the sea, even
though there may be pronounced waves, can be
noted. If the submarine is moving along near the
surface, the ripple is very pronounced, and the
streak of oil which follows is very narrow. Should
the submarine stop, the oil it discharges accumulates
on top of the water at one place, and begins
to spread out over the surface of the water and
this makes it a mark for the watchful eye of the
airmen of the sea patrols," answered the captain.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>"I heard one of the officers at the aviation camp
say that a submarine could be seen easily through
fifty feet of water by an airman," remarked Alfred.
"Do you think that is so?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I know it is possible," replied the captain.</p>

<p>"But why is it that when you are on a ship it is
impossible to see through the water that depth?"</p>

<p>"For this reason," answered the captain: "if
you are on a ship, and you are looking even from
the topmast of the vessel, the line of vision from
the eye strikes the surface of the water at an angle.
The result is that the surface of the water acts as
a reflector, exactly the same as when the line of
sight strikes a pane of glass."</p>

<p>"Do you mean that the sight is reflected just as
it is when you are outside of a house and try to
look into the window at an angle?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"Exactly; that is one explanation. The other
is this: sea water is clear and transparent. By
looking down directly on the water, a dark object,
unless too far below the surface, will be noted for
the reason that it makes a change in the coloring
from the area surrounding it, and a cigar-shaped
object at fifty feet below, whether it should be
black or white, would quickly be detected," explained
the captain.</p>

<p>"I remember that Lieutenant Winston, who has
flown across the channel many times, told me that
he could tell when he was nearing land, in a fog,
by sailing close to the water, even though the land
couldn't be seen. Do you know how he was able
to do that?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>"That is one of the simplest problems," replied
the captain. "The shallower the water the lighter
the appearance to an observer in an airship. As
the water grows deeper the color seems to grow
greener and bluer, the bluest being at the greatest
depth."</p>

<p>The chaser was now under way, and described
a circle to the right. The captain, after saluting
the officer on the bridge of <i>l'Orient</i>, gave the signal
"Forward," and slowly the submarine sheered
about and followed.</p>

<p>The second line of buoys appeared a quarter of
a mile to the east of the one they had just left. In
a half-hour the two vessels passed through the
gateway and turned to the north.</p>

<p>"We can't be very far from England," remarked
Alfred.</p>

<p>"I judge we are fifteen miles from Dover," replied
the captain.</p>

<p>"Do you intend to go to Dover?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"No; there are no stations there that can receive
crafts of this kind. I do not know to what
point they may take us; possibly to the mouth of
the Thames, and from there to some point where
the vessel will be interned," answered the captain.</p>

<p>"How deep is the channel here?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"Probably not to exceed 120 feet," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Not more than that in the middle of the Channel,&mdash;half
way between England and France?"
asked Alfred in surprise.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>"No; the Channel is very shallow," answered
the captain.</p>

<p>"No wonder then," said Alfred, "that the submarines
are having such a hard time getting
through, even though they don't have the nets!"</p>

<p>Having passed the cordon of nets the chaser
turned and slowly steamed past the submarine.
The lieutenant stepped to the side of the bridge
and said:</p>

<p>"I suppose, Captain, you can now make the pier-head
at Ramsgate, where you will get a ship to
convoy you to the harbor. Good luck to you!
Adieu!"</p>

<p>The boys waved their caps in salute, as the
chaser began to move, and the crew lined up to
give the final goodbye.</p>

<p>The captain smiled and replied: "I think I have
ample assistance on board; give my regards to the
admiral."</p>

<p>"How far is it to Ramsgate?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"It cannot be more than twenty-five miles, and
at the rate we are now going we should reach the
head at five this evening. That will be the end of
our troubles, as the naval officials will take care
of this vessel from that point," said the captain.</p>

<p>"Well, I shall be glad of it," replied Alfred.</p>

<p>It was a glorious day, the sun was shining
brightly, and the air, although somewhat cool, was
not at all disagreeable. The boys insisted on taking
their turns at the wheel, the course being given
by the captain as west by north. Everything was
moving along in fine shape, and Alfred was at the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>wheel, while Ralph was peering through the periscope,
for this interested them
from the moment they boarded
the ship.</p>

<p>"Where is that steamer
bound?" asked Ralph, who noticed
a large two-funnel steamer
crossing the field of the periscope.</p>

<p>"It belongs to the Australian
line," replied the captain.</p>

<p>"Aren't we in the barred
zone?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"I was about to remark a
moment ago that it does not seem
as though the German edict of a
restricted zone makes much difference
in the sailing of vessels,"
replied the captain.</p>

<p>While speaking, the submarine
seemed to slow down, and the
captain turned toward the conning
tower. "I wonder what is
up now?" he asked.</p>

<p>Alfred's head appeared at the
door and shouted: "They don't
seem to answer my signals."</p>

<p>The captain entered the tower,
and pulled the lever, <i>Attention!</i>
There was no response to the
signal below the word. He again rang, with the
same result.</p>

<p class="cen" style="margin-top: .2em;"><i>The Periscope</i><span class="totoi"><a href="#toi">ToList</a></span></p>
</div>

<p>"I will open the hatch," said the captain.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>It was quickly swung open. The sub-lieutenant
appeared at the hatch with haggard face and staring
eyes. "The captain has gone mad!" he
shouted.</p>

<p>"I will go down if you want me to; I am not
afraid," said Ralph.</p>

<p>The captain looked at him for a moment, and
glanced down into the hatchway. "Why do you
not obey my signals?" he asked.</p>

<p>The sub-lieutenant stared at the captain, but
did not make a reply. "Answer my question!"
shouted the captain.</p>

<p>The officer raised his face, threw up his hands,
and fell back across the low railing, which served
as a guard at the foot of the stairs.</p>

<p>"You may go down, and ascertain what is the
matter, but use caution," said the captain.</p>

<p>Ralph stepped into the open hatch, and, as he
did so, the captain laid his hand on his shoulder,
and said: "Take out your revolver; do not trust
those men for a moment, under any consideration;
we know them too well."</p>

<p>Ralph quickly drew the weapon and held it in his
hand, then cautiously descended. He passed the
inert form of the officer on the rail, and not until he
reached the last step did he see the doctor and the
chief machinist by the side of the dynamo.</p>

<p>The doctor held a revolver, which he pointed
straight at Ralph. "Drop that revolver!"
shouted the doctor. "The lieutenant is dead, and
the time fuse will soon send this ship to the bottom."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>The moment he saw the revolver and heard the
voice, Ralph dropped behind the stanchions to
which the stairway was attached. The doctor's revolver
was fired. Instantly the captain divined the
cause. Without waiting for a warning cry from
Ralph, he leaped into the open hatch, and saw the
two men with their weapons. He covered them
with his revolver.</p>

<p>"Come up!" he shouted to Ralph.</p>

<p>The latter raised up from his crouching position,
with his revolver now leveled full in the faces of
the two frenzied men. Before Ralph had reached
the upper step both men in the hold fired, fortunately,
without doing any damage.</p>

<p>The moment Ralph gained the deck the captain
jumped out of the hatch and slammed it down.</p>

<p>"Now, quickly, boys; tie this rope to the railing
close to the periscope tube, and arm yourself with
the life preservers; there, you will find them under
that couch," said the captain, as he quickly threw
back the cover from the couch and handed out four
preservers.</p>

<p>"Why do you want four?" asked Ralph, as he
hastily buckled one of them around himself.</p>

<p>"To attach to the end of the line that you have
just fastened to the rail," replied the captain.</p>

<p>The captain sprang out through the open door,
and attached one of the life belts to the end of the
line. The boys now noticed the coil of rope, which
must have been more than a hundred feet in length.</p>

<p>"I wonder what that is for?" asked Alfred, as
the captain disappeared.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>"There," said the captain, as he again appeared
at the door. "If she goes down that preserver will
tell them where to fish for her."</p>

<p>"Do you think there is any danger?" asked
Ralph.</p>

<p>"I do not know; I am not taking any chances.
I have my opinion, though," replied the captain
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Do you think they are going to blow up the vessel?"
asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"No; but I am inclined to think that they have
not been able to disconnect the automatic fuse,
or, that the death of the lieutenant, if such should
be the case, has prevented them from finding the
secret key, and,&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That the sub-lieutenant has actually gone
mad," interrupted Ralph.</p>

<p>The captain nodded, and continued: "Although
they deserve death, still, I am not a barbarian, and
shall give them a chance for their lives," and, saying
this, he moved through the door, and, sighting
a large steamer, gave a signal. Once, twice, three
times he moved the flag from right to left. Almost
immediately there was a response and two short
whistles responded.</p>

<p>Before the great ship had time to stop, the forward
end of the submarine moved upward with
a violent heave, followed by an explosion that
seemed to tear everything to pieces. Ralph was
thrown clear of the top, and landed fully twenty
feet from the side of the hull. Alfred and the captain
seemed to be propelled to the stern of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>ship and dashed into the waves at least fifty feet
from the spot where Ralph had landed.</p>

<p>Ralph did not appear to be even stunned, but
Alfred's head dropped lifeless on the side of the
life preserver, and the captain was prompt to
reach his side and support him so that his head
was kept free from the water.</p>

<p>Ralph was bewildered at the suddenness of the
affair, and, while splashing in the water, glanced
first at the captain and Alfred, and then swung
around to get a view of the big ship, which they
had signalled. The submarine had vanished. The
sea around appeared to be a mass of bubbles, and
he could plainly see the petroleum which was oozing
up.</p>

<p>Nothing was visible where the submarine floated
but a single belt,&mdash;the life preserver which the captain
had used as a buoy, to mark the location of the
sunken vessel.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h2>THE RESCUE IN THE CHANNEL</h2>
<br />

<p>"The boat is on the way," shouted the captain,
as Ralph tried to direct himself toward the captain
and Alfred.</p>

<p>"We were just in time," said Ralph. "How is
Alfred?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Only stunned," replied the captain. "I think
he hit the conning tower as the vessel up-ended."</p>

<p>"Poor fellows," said Ralph, "I suppose it's all
up with them."</p>

<p>"They are gone beyond all help. But we did
the best we could," answered the captain. "Here,
take this fellow first," continued the captain, addressing
the officer in charge of the boat.</p>

<p>The boys were soon dragged in, and the officer
gazed at the captain most earnestly, as he said:
"Why, Captain, we heard just before we left the
dock about you and two boys capturing a submarine;
was that the submarine? What has happened?"</p>

<p>"That is a long story, but you shall hear it as
soon as we get aboard. Where are you bound?"
asked the captain.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>"For the Mediterranean," replied the officer.</p>

<p>"Where is your first port?" asked the captain.</p>

<p>"Havre," was the answer.</p>

<p>"Couldn't be better," replied the captain.
"Ah! I see Alfred is coming around all right."</p>

<p>"He seems to be breathing all right now," said
Ralph.</p>

<p>"So they heard about our exploit?" asked the
captain.</p>

<p>"Why, yes; the papers made quite an item about
it; I think we have a copy on board," replied the
officer.</p>

<p>As the boys ascended the ship's ladder they saw
two torpedo boat destroyers crowd up alongside
the ship. The captain leaned over the taff-rail and
said:</p>

<p>"The buoy yonder marks the resting place of
the U-96, late in the service of the Imperial German
Navy. Please report same, with my compliments."</p>

<p>Alfred was taken aboard and the ship's doctor
was soon in attendance. Every one crowded
around and the names of the boys and the captain
were soon known to all the passengers. The <i>Evening
Mail</i> gave the most interesting account of the
affair, and Ralph read and re-read the item.</p>

<p>An hour afterwards, when everything had time
to quiet down, and Alfred had recovered sufficiently
to sit up, Ralph drew out the newspaper,
and, to the surprise of Alfred, read the following:</p>

<br />
<p class="cen">"AN EXTRAORDINARY FEAT<br /><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
<br />
"A SUBMARINE CAPTURED BY THREE PRISONERS</p>
<br />

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The war is a never-ending series of startling
and remarkable events, the latest being the capture
of a German submarine by the captain of one of
the transatlantic liners and two American boys
who were passengers on the captain's ship when
she was torpedoed. The commander of the submarine
took the captain and the two boys from
the boat in which they had sought refuge, after
their vessel went down in the Bay of Biscay.</p>

<p>"It was learned from the first officer of one of
the torpedo-boats that the submarine while on its
way to Germany was caught in the nets in mid-channel.
While trying to disentangle itself, the
chief officer of the submarine met with an accident,
and, taking advantage of the situation, the
captain and his two boy companions, having found
a case of revolvers, held up the second officer and
the crew, and imprisoned them below.</p>

<p>"They are now bringing the submarine to England,
and we hope to be able to give more details
tomorrow."</p></div>

<p>"There, what do you think of that?" ejaculated
Ralph.</p>

<p>Alfred smiled, but a shadow came over his face,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>as he looked at Ralph. The latter, seeing the
change, jumped up, and cried: "Are you sick?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Alfred wearily; "but I have been
thinking of father and mother; I had a dream that
I saw them standing on a dock; I wonder where
they are?"</p>

<p>"I have some interesting news for you," said
the captain, as he entered the cabin, holding a
French paper in his hand.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked the boys in unison.</p>

<p>"Boats three, four and five of our ship have
reached port all right," said the captain.</p>

<p>"Have you heard about No. 1?" asked Alfred,
as he leaned forward, and anxiously awaited the
reply.</p>

<p>"No; but it is likely that the other boats may
have been picked up by a west bound vessel, and it
is not time yet to hear from the other side," replied
the captain.</p>

<p>"But do you think they are safe?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"I do not see that they were in any great danger,
as there was calm weather for at least forty-eight
hours after the ship went down," answered
the captain. "I understand that all but three of
the boats have been accounted for."</p>

<p>"Have the submarines been doing much damage?"
asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"Yes; they have sunk a great many ships," was
the answer.</p>

<p>"Any American ships?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"No; but a number of Americans have lost their
lives on vessels that have been sunk."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>"Where are we going?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"To Havre," was the reply.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't worry about father and mother
now," said Ralph soothingly.</p>

<p>"No, indeed; the boats were perfectly safe, and
I have no doubt but we shall hear from them by the
time we reach port," reassured the captain.</p>

<p>Ralph waited until Alfred dropped off to sleep,
and then strolled up on deck and mixed with the
passengers. He was kept busy telling them about
the terrible hours on board the submarine, until he
was tired and sleepy. Then he wended his way to
the cabin and was soon asleep.</p>

<p>The distance from the point where they boarded
the ship to Havre was about two hundred miles.
Ordinarily, they would have reached port at six in
the morning, but the route during the night was a
slow and tedious one, for the reason that all
ships along the channel route were permitted to
pass only during certain hours when the war vessels
acted as guides and convoys through the open
lane.</p>

<p>Once near the zone of the nets no lights were
permitted, and each ship had to be taken through
by special vessels designated for this work, and,
when once clear of the nets, extra precautions were
taken to convoy them to relative points of safety
beyond.</p>

<p>When Ralph awoke the next morning, and saw
that it was past six, he hurriedly dressed himself,
and, taking a look at Alfred, who was quietly sleeping,
ascended the deck. He was surprised to see
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>nothing but the open sea on all sides. Addressing
a seaman, he asked:</p>

<p>"Haven't we reached Havre yet?"</p>

<p>"No; we may not get there until nine o'clock.
We have had reports of many submarines in the
mouth of the channel, and they are, probably, lying
in wait to intercept steamers going to or coming
from Havre," replied the man.</p>

<p>Pacing the deck he found many of the passengers
excited at the news, although it was the policy
of the officers to keep the most alarming information
from them. Meeting the second officer he inquired
about the captain, and was informed that
he had just gone down to see Alfred. Nearing the
companionway he met the captain and Alfred, the
latter looking somewhat pale, and rather weak or
unsteady in his walk.</p>

<p>"I am glad to see you looking so well," said
Ralph. "Where are you hurt the most?"</p>

<p>"Look at the back of my head," replied Alfred.
"I suppose I must have struck the railing as the
thing heaved up."</p>

<p>The captain suddenly sprang forward and the
boys followed in wonderment. Before they had
time to ask any questions they were startled by a
shot.</p>

<p>"That was a pretty big gun to make such a
racket," remarked Ralph.</p>

<p>"It's one of the four-inch forward guns," said
a seaman, standing near.</p>

<p>"But what are they shooting at?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"Submarine, I suppose," was the reply.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>"But where?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"Don't know; haven't seen one; but I suppose
the lookouts spotted the fellow," was the reply.</p>

<p>Every one now crowded forward, and gazed in
the direction of the pointed glasses in the hands of
the officers. In the distance nothing was visible
but the conning tower and the two periscope tubes,
but that was enough.</p>

</div>

<p>The boys moved forward, and the captain noticing
them, spoke a word to the commander on
the bridge.</p>

<p>"Come up, boys," said the captain.</p>

<p>Once on the bridge the captain said: "I take
pleasure in introducing my companions on our <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>little
jaunt; they are brave fellows, and are made of
the right kind of stuff. I think you will hear from
them if America gets into the fight."</p>

<p>"And America is bound to get in, for we have
just learned that the first American ship has been
sunk without warning," said the navigating officer,
as he pressed the hands of the boys.</p>

<p>The captain took up the receiver, which communicated
with the topmast. After listening
awhile, he turned to the group and said: "The sub
has disappeared."</p>

<p>"That will mean an interesting time for us,"
said the captain. "I have had the same experience,
but was not fortunate enough to be armed
when they attacked us. Are all the vessels from
England now armed?" he asked the captain commanding
the vessel.</p>

<p>"Yes; fore and aft. We have found that but a
small percentage of armed vessels have been sunk,
and those which have guns at both ends are surely
doubly armed," answered the commander.</p>

<p>The boom of the guns had brought every passenger
on deck. The officers could not conceal the
real state of affairs, but there was no sign of a
panic. The officers did not even take the precaution
to warn the passengers that they should apply
or keep the life belts close at hand.</p>

<p>"That is the policy I suggested from the first,"
said the captain. "That boat must have been
three miles away, at least, and a careful gunner
would come pretty close to hitting the mark at
that distance, and those fellows know it."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>"Then why do you think the interesting or dangerous
time is now coming?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"Because the safety of the ship now depends on
the ability of the observers to report the moment
a periscope appears in sight. If the submarine is
close enough to fire a torpedo, it is near enough to
be a fine target for the gunners aboard, and, as the
submarine would not be likely to attempt a shot
unless it had a broadside to aim at, you can see
that such a position would expose her to the fire
of the guns both fore and aft," responded the captain.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h2>TEN HOURS IN THE DANGER ZONE</h2>
<br />

<p>"What do you make the reckoning?" asked the
captain, as the navigating officer lowered his instrument,
and turned to the book.</p>

<p>"Fifty, ten north," was the reply.</p>

<p>"On the line?" asked the captain.</p>

<p>"Twelve minutes east," answered the officer.</p>

<p>"Then we are forty miles due north of Havre,"
responded the captain.</p>

<p>"What did you mean by being 'on the line?'"
asked Ralph, addressing the captain.</p>

<p>"The zero line, or the point where all calculations
east and west are reckoned from, runs north
and south through Greenwich, in England, a place
a little east of London. We are about fifteen miles
east of that line," replied the captain, "and one
hundred and eighty miles south of London."</p>

<p>But all were now interested in the further developments
which might be expected. The wireless
was constantly receiving messages, and occasionally
the commander received messages which
were, evidently, interesting reading, judging from
the comments made. Most of the information related
to the activities of the undersea boats, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>only in that region where they were now approaching.</p>

<p>The vessel was proceeding slowly, when suddenly
the officer in the crow's nest sent down a
signal that vitalized the gunners. The guns swung
around instantly. Away off to starboard was the
faintest ripple, for the water was comparatively
smooth.</p>

<p>Two shots rang out almost simultaneously from
the fore and aft guns. It was a thrilling sight to
see the streaks of glistening water, which the two
shells brought up to be reflected by the brilliant
sun. A shout from the gunner at the bow caused
a chorus of answering shouts.</p>

<p>"Did they hit it?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"Well, there is one less periscope, if I know anything,"
replied the navigating officer.</p>

<p>Ralph had descended the stairs leading down
from the bridge, and quickly made his way to the
bow.</p>

<p>"I want to congratulate you on that shot," he
said, as he approached.</p>

<p>The gunner, with glowing face, turned, and,
seeing Ralph, replied: "Thank you, lad! Coming
from you it's a compliment. Lor', but we like to
spot 'em."</p>

<p>"That fellow's as good as useless," remarked
the officer in charge.</p>

<p>"But suppose the submarine has any torpedoes
left?" queried Ralph.</p>

<p>"That wouldn't do him any good; he would have
to use that to sight by," replied the officer.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>"Yes; I can see that now," replied Ralph. "If
he came to the top in order to fire the torpedo he
wouldn't last very long with these guns pointing
at him."</p>

<p>As Ralph was ascending the stairway leading
to the bridge on his return a half-hour later, the
watch shouted out a warning: "Five points to
starboard!"</p>

<p>Every one was now keyed up to the highest
pitch. The guns were quickly swung to the angle
indicated, and another tense moment arrived.</p>

<p>The captain walked over to the commander, and
said: "It seems to me that the best policy is to
bear down on him with all speed possible. That
will give the gunners the best chance, and at the
same time present the smallest target for the submarine."</p>

<p>The commander nodded and gave the necessary
order, but before the helmsman had time to execute
the turning movement the forward gun was
heard, quickly followed by the second gun. The
aft gun also responded, making three shots that
were fired, striking the water in such close proximity
to each other that the aim must have been
very accurate.</p>

<p>"Gunners from the Royal Navy," remarked the
captain, as he lowered his glasses. "And they
have hit the mark."</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"I am sure of it, for this reason," said the captain,
as the officers on the bridge crowded around;
"neither of the periscopes is visible, and I can
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>plainly see the boiling that follows a sinking submarine."</p>

<p>The ship was now at full speed, sailing directly
over the course where the submarine was sighted.
It did not take long for the vessel to cover the
mile, and, as they neared the tell-tale spot, the
ship was veered slightly out of its course, so that
a good view could be obtained of the surface of
the water.</p>

<p>"How deep do you suppose that submarine is
now?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"It is in less than two hundred feet of water;
see, the air bubbles are still coming up, although
it went down fully fifteen minutes ago."</p>

<p>The steamer slowed down as it came abreast,
and the passengers leaned over the side in intense
excitement, watching the signs which indicated the
death of another sea terror. Even while they were
watching one immense boiling zone appeared and
settled down, indicating that another air tank had
given way, or that the pressure of the sea water
had forced the air from one of the innumerable
pockets in the interior of the submarine.</p>

<p>Four bells indicated a resumption of the journey.
The great funnels began to pour forth smoke
in immense volumes, and the ship fairly shook with
the revolutions of the twin screws.</p>

<p>"So we are going directly south," said Ralph,
who had just examined the compass, and started
for the stairway.</p>

<p>"There will be no let-up now," remarked the
captain.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>Every one understood that forced draught
would now be resorted to, both to avoid the likelihood
of being torpedoed, and also to enable the
ship to reach port at the earliest possible moment.
The <i>St. Duneen</i>, although a twin-screw vessel, was
not of more than 5,000 tons burden, having been
built as a mail carrier for distant ports, in which
speed was regarded as the important element in
her construction.</p>

<p>As the commander remarked to the captain,
after the latter reached the bridge, he felt sure that
the speed alone, which he was able to make in an
emergency, would baffle any attempt to reach his
hull. It seemed so, for the vessel fairly skimmed
the surface of the water, and left a trail which
could be marked for miles.</p>

<p>Every one felt happy, and there was a feeling
of security aboard that was shared by every one.
Luncheon was announced, and the boys were descending
the stairway leading to the cabin, when
they felt a peculiar sensation. They were thrown
down the steps, taking with them several women
and children, who were alongside.</p>

<p>No sooner had they landed at the bottom, when
the most terrific crash was heard.</p>

<p>"Submarine!" shrieked a voice.</p>

<p>The sensation of the oscillating movement of the
vessel was a sickening one. The dining room was
half-filled with women, children and men.</p>

<p>"To your cabins at once; life belts as quickly as
possible!" shouted an officer. "The men must aid
the women and children. Do not become excited."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>This warning had a marked effect; it restored
the confidence which had been so rudely shocked.
Ralph and Alfred sprang for the closets where the
life preservers were kept, and threw them out on
the floor as fast as they could grasp them. They
caught up one child after the other, and, without
heeding the resistance which some offered, adjusted
the belts, and, as fast as this was done, they
assisted in pushing the children toward the companionway.</p>


<div class="img"><a name="imagep156" id="imagep156"></a>

<p class="cen" style="margin-top: .2em;"><i>A Contact Mine</i><span class="totoi"><a href="#toi">ToList</a></span></p>
</div>

<p>The ship was slowly sinking to one side. The
angle was very perceptible, and especially noticed
as the boys reached the stairway, for it was found
to be impossible to ascend by the starboard stairs.
This made it more difficult to get the people out
of the crowded rooms below.</p>

<p>"Don't get excited!" shouted the officer from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>the head of the stairs. "We can all clear the ship
safely before she goes down."</p>

<p>As fast as the passengers reached the deck, officers
were present to direct them to the most advantageous
boats, but no orders were given to man
the boats. The bow of the ship had gone down,
and she was now lying at a considerable angle, but
it was evident that there was considerable buoyancy
in the vessel, and that there was no immediate
danger.</p>

<p>"Are you sure that all are out of the cabins?"
asked the captain, as one of the porters appeared
at the end of the passageway.</p>

<p>"We might as well take a look," said Alfred,
as he rushed toward the port passage.</p>

<p>"I will go through the other passageway and
meet you at the aft stairway," said Ralph, as he
darted toward the gangway leading along the right
side of the ship.</p>

<p>Alfred diligently opened every door and glanced
about; he was not long in reaching the aft stairway
area, and waited for some minutes for Ralph
to appear. As he was crossing the open space between
the two passageways, he heard a shriek,
followed by piercing screams, evidently from the
port passage.</p>

<p>Directed by the sounds he sprang from door to
door, and soon detected a terrific struggle.
"Help! help! I am being murdered!" was the
cry.</p>

<p>At the door of a cabin Alfred saw two forms,
one the woman, and the other Ralph in a fierce
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>struggle, the woman with her arms around the
post, which extended upward from the floor at
the side of the cabin couch. She defied every effort
on the part of Ralph. Alfred seized her
hands, gradually loosened them, and when they
had succeeded in freeing her, she dropped down,
completely exhausted, threw her head to one side,
and swooned.</p>

<p>This greatly facilitated her removal. The boys
dragged her along the passageway, and, nearing
the stairs, noticed a peculiar sound, something like
a muffled explosion, followed by a sudden lurch
of the ship, which destroyed their balance so that
they were compelled to drop their burden.</p>

<p>"What can that be?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"Seems as though we have been hit the second
time," replied Alfred.</p>

<p>"Oh! here you are!" shouted the captain, as he
rushed down the stairway, followed by an officer.</p>

<p>"What was that?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"A bulkhead has just given way," replied the
captain.</p>

<p>"Then we are bound to go down," said Alfred
with a sigh. "We must get her up before she
comes to."</p>

<p>"Yes, but we'll try to save her," replied the captain.</p>

<p>The ship was slowly sinking. The motion of a
vessel as it loses its buoyancy gives a most peculiar
feeling to those on board, independently of the
knowledge that danger is lurking very near. The
sinking motion is not a smooth and steady going
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>down, but the movement is accompanied by successive
throbs, as it seems,&mdash;it almost appears as
though the ship were a living thing, sobbing away,
until the final plunge takes place.</p>

<p>Aided by the captain and the officer, the woman
was quickly brought to the deck, where it was
learned that her husband had lost his life on a torpedoed
vessel a month before. She opened her
eyes as they were placing her in the boat, and instantly
recognized Ralph.</p>

<p>"Did I resist and try to injure you?" she asked.
"Forgive me!" she said pleadingly. "But I have
had so much trouble. You must be a brave boy to
act as you did."</p>

<p>"Don't mind that for a minute," replied Ralph.
"We were bound to get you out; we didn't think
of anything else."</p>

<p>"Come on, boys; take the boat at the next
davit," said the captain. "I will be with you in
a moment."</p>

<p>The boys entered the little dory and sat down.
The navigating officer was the last one to step in.
He stood there with his instruments in his hands,
and cast a gloomy look along the deck. "Too bad,
too bad!" he said reflectively.</p>

<p>"Say, Ralph, I have an idea that we are hoodoos!"
said Alfred, with a serious air.</p>

<p>"Who is a hoodoo?" asked the captain, approaching
and overhearing the conversation.</p>

<p>"Hoodoo, nothing!" answered Ralph.</p>

<p>"Well, it begins to look like it," responded Alfred.
"There is some sort of deviltry around
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>wherever we have happened to be ever since the
war began."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the gravity of the situation, the
captain could not repress a smile, which he quickly
suppressed, as he answered:</p>

<p>"Then what would you call me? They have
sunk four ships under me by torpedoes, and one by
a mine. You have seen and experienced some of
the other adventures I have had within the past
ten days, and now this is another vessel to go
down under me on account of a mine," said the
captain.</p>

<p>"A mine! a mine, did you say?" almost shrieked
Alfred.</p>

<p>"Yes; one of the floating mines that the Germans
are strewing about in open defiance of all
the laws," answered the captain with a bitter
voice.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h2>A FRIGHTFUL MINE EXPLOSION</h2>
<br />

<p>The order was given. There was no hope for
the ship. "Lower the boats!" Everything was
done with precision and in order, indicating that
there was no panic on shipboard. Up to the last
moment the wireless S. O. S., <i>St. Duneen</i>, 48, 50
N., 10 E., repeated and repeated the message of
the disaster.</p>

<p>At a signal the wireless operator obeyed the
commander's orders, and emerged from the little
room high up aft of the main stacks. He sprang
into the boat, as it was moving down.</p>

<p>"Pull away! pull away!" shouted the commander,
as the boats reached the surface of the
water. The order and its execution did not come
too soon. Like a giant, in a death struggle, there
were a few spasmodic movements, and more pronounced
ones as the bulkheads gave way.</p>

<p>They were fully two hundred feet from the ship,
when suddenly it seemed to roll around half-way,
and they could look over the entire deck, so fully
was it exposed to those on board of the dory in
which the boys had taken refuge.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>The vessel rested on its side for a moment only,
then it slowly staggered back, the bow quickly
dipped, and failed to come back again. Then it
seemed actually to slide forward into the depths,
the stern rising higher and higher, as the bow
moved under. More than fifty feet of the stern
of the ship was still out of the water, when a peculiar
thing happened. The hull ceased to move.
It remained at an angle in the air for a quarter of
a minute, while every one stared at it in silence.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with it?" asked Alfred,
who was the first to break the silence.</p>

<p>"The bow is on the bottom of the ocean," said
the captain.</p>

<p>That was, indeed, true. Soon it began to sink,
by falling back, and it quietly sank beneath the
waves, leaving scarcely a ripple above the surface.</p>

<p>"That would have been different if she had been
struck amidship, for the hull would have gone
down on an even keel," remarked the commander.</p>

<p>The nine boats were now afloat near each other.
In the distance could be seen smoke in two directions,
evidence that vessels were not far away.
Then, almost like an apparition, from the east
came two of the speedy little ships, which act like
spit-fires and lie so low in the water that they are
able to creep up unawares. They do not give forth
any smoke to warn an enemy, or indicate their
presence to friends.</p>

<p>Long before the ships, which had announced
their positions by the smoke on the horizon, came
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>into sight, the saucy chasers were sailing around
and about the fleet of <i>St. Duneen's</i> boats.</p>

<p>"It rather makes me feel good to think that we
didn't get caught by either of the submarines,"
said Alfred. "I would hate to give them that satisfaction."</p>

<p>"But what's the difference, after all?" replied
Ralph. "So long as they sink the ships, what matter
does it make whether they do it by mines or
submarines?"</p>

<p>"Yes; one is as bad as the other, both done
against all law," answered Alfred.</p>

<p>The first boat to answer the signal was a French
cruiser, which came up rapidly after the chasers
arrived. There was ample room on board for the
passengers, but it took fully an hour before all
were safe on board and orders were given to start.
As the cruiser turned, a great, gray British battleship
came up to port, saluted, and passed on,
followed by another far in the distance, those two
great vessels with their black smoke trailing out
in the distance and moving along majestically
seeming to be the acme of power.</p>

<p>The boys were on the upper deck and watched
the scene with admiration. Before the cruiser had
proceeded far the smoke of more than a dozen
ships were visible, and the boys could not help
but be impressed at the tremendous power of the
Allies on the water, notwithstanding the calamity
which had just befallen their ship. After all, the
ships had been sunk by an enemy which dared not
show his face above the surface of the water.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>"Submarine sunk near the harbor of Brest and
one off Cherburg," was the startling announcement
of the wireless operator. "Five American
ships have arrived at the Loire," was another message.
"America is aflame with excitement, and
demands action," came later.</p>

<p>"Is it possible that the United States will go to
war?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"The United States is now at war," replied the
captain.</p>

<p>"What? do you mean to say that the President
has declared war?" asked Alfred in astonishment.</p>

<p>"No; it is not necessary that America should
declare war. Germany has done so by torpedoing
your ships, and killing your citizens; that is an act
of war; for every nation, and Germany itself,
knows that its submarine war is illegal, and without
any standing in International Law. It is no
justification to say that to give notice makes it
legal. If a man wished to commit murder it would
not make him less a murderer if he had given notice
of his intention beforehand," said the captain.</p>

<p>"Then I'm not going back to New York," said
Alfred.</p>

<p>"Nor I; we've been in it from the first, and we
might as well stick it out;&mdash;if I only knew that
mother was safe," concluded Ralph with a shadow
across his face.</p>

<p>Within an hour the boys saw a faint streak of
peculiar gray to the left, far ahead.</p>

<p>"That must be land," said Alfred.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>"And that looks like a town, away in the distance,"
remarked Ralph.</p>

<p>"You are right; that is the coast of France,
and the houses you see belong to the town of
F&egrave;camp, a seaport and watering place, 22 miles
from Havre," said the navigating officer.</p>

<p>Every minute brought them nearer the city of
Havre. How they longed to hear some news of
their parents, now that all excitement had died
away, and they were permitted to think of home
and those dear to them.</p>

<p>Vessels began to accumulate on all sides of them,
indications that they were now within the safety
zone. For a period of eight days they had not
known what absolute quiet and rest meant. First,
the terrible suspense within the hull of a submarine,
the trying experience attending the capture
of the vessel, the unquiet feeling that they had
desperate men below who might do anything to
gain their liberty, the explosion and sinking of the
submarine, their rescue, and then the last sinking,
seemed to form a chapter of misadventures which
constantly kept them on the alert.</p>

<p>It was such a different feeling now, and, as such
things generally do, caused a reaction. They actually
felt ill, and Alfred, especially, after the last
accident, felt too weak to remain on deck.</p>

<p>They retired to the cabin assigned to them in
the officers' quarters, and were soon asleep. The
captain, missing them, made a search and soon
found them. He smiled, and, turning to the officers,
said:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>"They are fine fellows; the experiences have
been most trying, and would test the mettle of
most men; but they went through with it, obeyed
all orders, without asking why, and never showed
the white feather."</p>

<p>"Who are they?" asked one of the cruiser's officers.</p>

<p>"American boys, caught in the war, where they
helped the fighting until two months ago, and were
just returning to the United States on my ship.
That is how I happened to meet them and learned
to love them," replied the captain with pride in
his voice.</p>

<p>As they were leaving the cabin, Alfred awoke.
"Are we near Havre?" he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>"We are now turning the point; we expect to
reach the dock in a half-hour," answered the officer.</p>

<p>Every one crowded the rails and watched the
ever-changing panorama, for Havre is the second
seaport in France, has the largest foreign trade,
especially with America, and is noted for its great
docks, and ship-building facilities.</p>

<p>"Hurrah for the Stars and Stripes!" shouted
Ralph, as he pointed to the banner above the mast
on a ship, which was just being warped out of the
dock.</p>

<p>The passengers, as well as officers and seamen
of the cruiser, took off their hats and cheered.
Ralph blushed at the hearty response, but he knew
that it was a tribute which they were paying to
America, about to become a new ally. The seamen
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>on board the American ship gave a hearty response
to the salute, and this swelled the pride of
the boys beyond measure.</p>

<p>How slowly the ship moved, now that they were
nearing the end of their journey from the perils of
the sea. How anxiously they awaited the time
they could step ashore and visit the consul's office,
there to learn, if possible, the fate of their parents.</p>

<p>"They are going to take us to the main foreign
dock," said the captain, as he approached. "And
I want to say that you must not get away from me
in your eagerness. There are some people who
want to talk to you and tell you how they appreciate
your bravery and good work."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Captain," said Alfred. "We had
no cause to fear, as long as you commanded."</p>

<p>"Indeed not," chimed in Ralph. "Even if we
knew other perils that might come to us, we would
be glad to follow you again wherever you ordered
us to go; that's the way we feel about it."</p>

<p>"That is, indeed, a compliment," replied the
captain.</p>

<p>"We have never felt the slightest fear or doubt,"
said Alfred, "but, of course, we have been sad
many times, to think that our parents were separated
from us, after we had not seen them for over
two years."</p>

<p>"There is the dock. We will be off within fifteen
minutes now. You must allow me to conduct
you to the consul's office; I know him very well,"
said the captain.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>As the vessel touched the dock the captain
turned to the boys, and said with a wicked grin on
his face: "Get your luggage, boys, and come on."</p>

<p>The boys laughed at the remark. "For my
part," answered Ralph, "I had forgotten that
there was such a thing as luggage, or baggage, or
anything of that sort."</p>

<p>"Ralph! Ralph! who is that coming across the
dock? Look! it is just like father! I believe it
is!" almost shrieked Alfred.</p>

<p>"It is! yes; I am sure of it; and there is mother,
too," replied Ralph, now all excitement.</p>

<p>"Of course, they are there; I knew it; I told you
it would be all right," said the captain with a jubilant
voice.</p>

<p>The boys glanced at the captain, and Ralph
turned his head slyly, as he said: "And did you
know they were here?"</p>

<p>"Well, I think they got my message this morning,"
replied the captain with a laugh. "Where is
your father; point him out," said the captain to
Alfred.</p>

<p>"The tall man with the gray overcoat; do you
see him coming?&mdash;and there is mother, too,"
shouted Alfred.</p>

<p>The boys were the first ones down the plank,
closely followed by the captain, the passengers
standing by and witnessing the reunion of the
families.</p>

<p>The captain came forward and shook hands with
Mr. Elton. "Thank you for the wireless; we had
about despaired, when it came to the hotel."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>"I didn't tell the boys," replied the captain. "I
left that pleasure for their own eyes; and here are
the mothers; how I must congratulate you on having
such sons. I know their worth."</p>

<p>"And is it true what they say about your doings
with our boys, that you captured the submarine,
while it was under the water?" asked Mrs. Elton.</p>

<p>"Yes, that was true, and much more," answered
the captain.</p>

<p>"We felt so proud about it," replied Mr. Elton,
"and it was some compensation for having been
twice torpedoed within a week."</p>

<p>"What? did you say that you were torpedoed
the second time?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Mr. Elton. "We were picked
up by a ship, the next morning, which was bound
for New York. Two days afterwards, when out
of the danger zone, our ship went down, and we
had to take to the boats. This time we were picked
up by a ship that landed us in Havre, three days
ago. Then we heard of your exploits, of which the
French papers were full, and we determined to
remain here until we heard from you."</p>

<p>"But I cannot understand how it was that the
captain happened to reach you by wireless?"
asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"The cruiser wireless telegraphed the fact of
our rescue to the U. S. consul, and I wired the
commander of the cruiser," replied Mr. Elton.</p>

<p>"I answered Mr. Elton's message," said the
captain with a smile. "But are you going back to
America now?" continued the captain.</p>

<p>"America is at war with Germany," was the
reply.</p>

<p>We shall now take leave of our young friends,
but we do so with the feeling that before long we
shall hear more about them, and be able to follow
their adventures enlisted under the banner of their
own beloved land in the fight against oppression
